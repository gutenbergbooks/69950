<h2>CHAPTER I.<br>

<span class="smcap fs70">The Acorn from which Grew the Oak.</span></h2>


<p>The First Regiment Ohio Volunteer Light Artillery—whose
guns thundered on nearly all the great battlefields
of the War for the Union, 1861-5—owed its existence
to a process of evolution. It was the result
of a growth during a period of more than twenty
years.</p>

<p>The Cleveland Grays, an independent military company,
was formed in 1837. It was composed of active,
intelligent, patriotic young men who displayed from
the first a laudable pride in the organization, and an
ambition to bring it up to the highest possible standard
of excellence. Their most praiseworthy efforts were
rewarded by a full measure of success, and the company
was soon celebrated far and near for its fine
appearance, excellent drill, and perfection of military
discipline.</p>

<p>In 1839, for the purpose of field instruction, the
Grays held an encampment on a vacant lot at the
present corner of Superior and Erie streets. As compared
to its proportions of today, Cleveland was
then scarcely more than an overgrown village,
and the territory in the vicinity of the spot designated
above—now covered, and for miles beyond, with business
houses and dwellings—was almost in its primeval
state. By invitation of the Grays, Major Fay’s Light
Artillery Company, of Buffalo, famous in those early
days for its skill in the art of gunnery, was present
at the encampment. The fine evolutions of this command
and its proficiency in working and handling
artillery attracted much attention and awakened a
lively interest in that arm of military science.</p>

<p>The Grays caught the artillery fever and at once
decided that they would have a gun squad. No sooner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
said than done, and nine members of the company
were detailed for that purpose, as follows:</p>

<p>David L. Wood was appointed Sergeant of the Gun
Squad. He had formerly lived in Buffalo and had
served as a gunner in Major Fay’s company, but had
removed to Cleveland and was an active and zealous
member of the Grays. A six-pound iron gun was obtained
and mounted on a carriage which, as well as the
caisson, was of home manufacture, made at the expense
of the company. The early drills were held in
a large barn situated on Erie street opposite the cemetery.
The building was owned by the Ohio Stage
Company, which, before the days of railroads, was operating
its lines of public conveyance. These premises
were used for five or six years, when more commodious
quarters were provided.</p>

<p>In 1840 there was a great gathering at Fort Meigs—a
military station at the rapids of the Maumee river,
near Perrysburg, Ohio, built by General William Henry
Harrison in 1813. A number of military companies from
various parts of the West attended the meeting—among
them the Cleveland Grays with its gun squad. The
members of both organizations distinguished themselves
by their accuracy in drill and their soldierly
bearing, for which they bore away a large share of the
honors.</p>

<p>Stimulated by their success to greater exertions the
young artillerists continued their practice with the
greatest assiduity, attaining a perfection that was in
the highest degree creditable, and they fairly deserved
the plaudits that were so freely bestowed upon them
whenever they appeared in public. Valuable instruction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
and assistance were received from members of
Major Fay’s company, before mentioned. The drill was
in the French style of tactics then in vogue, and generally
known as “flying artillery.”</p>

<p>In 1845 the gun squad “seceded” from the Grays,
forming a separate organization known as the Cleveland
Light Artillery, with two 12-pound guns, and
a large increase in its active membership. David L.
Wood was chosen captain. Among those who at this
early day belonged to the company were James Barnett,
W. E. Lawrence, Seymour Race, W. H. Hayward and
W. E. Standart, all of whom remained in active membership
and were prominent during the war as members
of the First Ohio Light Artillery.</p>

<p>The increase in the company, both in size and equipment,
made it necessary to have better quarters. An
armory was built on Bank street, in the rear of what
is now the block next north of the Mercantile National
Bank, and the company evacuated the old Erie street
barn. It was at this time fully organized as a mounted
battery of two pieces, with caissons, harness, and everything
complete, all of which equipment was provided
at private expense, as were also the uniforms of the
men. Whenever the battery appeared on public occasions
or went out for field practice all expenses including
the use of horses were borne by the company.</p>

<p>On September 10, 1846, a large military encampment
was held at Wooster, Ohio, in which the Cleveland
Light Artillery was invited to participate. The
company, fully mounted and equipped, made the march
from Cleveland to and from that place, the distance
both ways being something over one hundred miles.
This would not have been considered much of a march
during the war, but it was the first campaign of the
company, and was a great event in those days. During
their stay at Wooster the artillerymen received the
highest encomiums for their excellent appearance and
drill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>July 4, 1847, a great river and harbor convention
was held at Chicago. The artillery accepted an urgent
invitation to attend, going by lake on the steamer
Sultana, a boat famous at that day, commanded by
Captain Gilman Appleby. While there the company
gave several exhibitions, acquitting itself with such
credit as to win unstinted praise. The effect was to
stir up the military spirit in Chicago to such a degree
that a light battery was at once organized there. The
Cleveland company furnished an instructor and otherwise
assisted in equipping the battery.</p>

<p>The Chicago company owed its existence in a great
measure to the Cleveland Artillery. It grew and
prospered, and early in the war became the nucleus of
the First Regiment Illinois Light Artillery, as the
Cleveland company did of the Ohio regiment. Indeed,
it may fairly be said that the influence of the Cleveland
Artillery was a wide-spread, and a potential factor,
through the removal of its members from time to time,
in awakening an interest before the war in that arm
of the military service. During the war there was no inconsiderable
number of artillery officers who entered
the army from other states, whose first instruction
was received years before, while members of the old
Cleveland battery. Its complement of men was usually
from seventy-five to one hundred, and during the twenty
years and more of its existence many of these dropped
out of the ranks and were widely scattered, their places
being filled by others. The seed thus sown produced an
abundant crop of artillerymen.</p>

<p>General Barnett tells that in the fall of 1863 he
was directing the march of some artillery through one
of the valleys between the mountain ranges near Chattanooga.
The weather was cold and wet and the roads
wretched. He came upon a Missouri battery stuck fast
in the Tennessee mud. Gun carriages and caissons
were sunk to the hubs and obstinately refused to budge
an inch, despite the floundering efforts of the panting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
horses and the picturesque profanity of the drivers.
Animals and men were wet and bespattered, and about
equally discouraged. The captain, in a despairing condition,
sat on his horse surveying the scene, apparently
caring little whether there were any stars left in the
old flag or not. Gen. Barnett doubled teams with him
and at length succeeded in “yanking” him out of the
mire. In conversation with him the general learned
that the captain was an old-time member of the Cleveland
artillery, and it was in consequence of what he
learned in that company that he was induced to raise
a battery and go to war in earnest.</p>

<p>In October, 1847, A. S. Sanford was elected captain
of the Artillery and continued in that position for
four years. David L. Wood was then again chosen and
continued in command until a short time before the
breaking out of the war.</p>

<p>The Cleveland Light Artillery was so successful and
popular that in 1851 it was doubled in strength and its
armament was increased to four guns. At this time
there was no organization of the militia of Ohio, and
very little had been done by the state authorities to
foster and encourage the military spirit. Few could
then have believed that ten years later the tocsin of
war would be sounded, and that more than three hundred
thousand men from Ohio alone would march to
the tented field—and not for holiday or “feather-bed”
soldiering, either. It is safe to say that Ohio will
never again be found in a state of such unreadiness—but
may the good Lord deliver us from any more war!
The survivors of the First Ohio Light Artillery will
all devoutly say Amen to this. Like all the rest who
served in the Civil War, they know when they have had
enough.</p>

<p>After much urging and coaxing the state authorities
did at length consent to lend a helping hand. When
the Cleveland Artillery was enlarged to a four-gun
battery the state furnished the guns and harness. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
company supplied everything else, including caissons,
uniforms, and equipments of every kind. It still retained
its status as an independent organization. In
fact there was no law of Ohio authorizing artillery
companies in any shape, and the small aid that was
grudgingly extended to the Cleveland battery was more
of a gratuity than anything else.</p>

<p>But the company continued to prosper just the same.
Its membership was composed of excellent material,
including young men from many of the best families of
the city. All were earnest and ambitious in their efforts
and they soon reached a high state of skill and efficiency
in handling their guns and in all the details of the tactics
in which they were instructed. They had showy uniforms
for public occasions, with plenty of red in them,
suggestive of sanguinary scenes, and presented a really
gorgeous appearance when parading the streets. They
won the applause of the multitude, the smiles of the
fair, and admiring yells from the small boys. For in
those ante-bellum days a cannon on wheels was regarded
with unspeakable awe; and a man in military
dress awakened the liveliest emotions in the popular
mind.</p>

<p>In February, 1852, the company was first called upon
for military duty. On the 17th of that month a serious
riot occurred at a medical college situated at the corner
of Prospect and Ontario streets. The trouble grew
out of the exposure of some human bones from the
dissecting room. A citizen who imagined them to be
the remains of his daughter, whose body he thought
had been stolen for dissection, gathered a formidable
mob of excited people and moved upon the college
with the avowed purpose of razing it to the ground and
of hanging the doctors and students to the nearest
lamp posts. The sheriff soon found that he had more
on hand than he could manage and ordered out the Light
Artillery to his assistance. The members of the company
responded with alacrity and promptly appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
upon the ground, unlimbering their pieces they double
shotted them in full view of the rioters, who were
warned that if they did not instantly disperse the
guns would be fired. The men stood at their posts,
ready to fire at the word, but the rioters broke and
fled from the scene, in a slate of confused demoralization.
For precautionary reasons the battery remained
on duty, “holding the fort,” for forty-eight hours, by
the end of which time the excitement had abated and
there was no repetition of the hostile demonstration.</p>

<p>This incident clearly showed the value of such a
body of trained men, to meet emergencies liable at
times to arise in a rapidly growing city, where sudden
excitement, often without reason, leads unthinking men
to acts of lawlessness, which set the civil authorities
at defiance. The company had fairly won its first victory,
fortunately a bloodless one. Its members were
highly complimented for their prompt response to the
call and their cool steadiness in the face of the excited
mob. It was an occasion to test the stuff they were
made of, though not to be compared with the scenes of
carnage that some of those men faced without flinching
in after years.</p>

<p>The people of Cleveland began to feel a pride in
the Light Artillery, and to give the company substantial
support and assistance. Again it became necessary
to have more commodious quarters, and sufficient
funds were contributed by the citizens and the members
of the company to build a new armory. The
building was erected in 1852, near the present junction
of Ohio and Hill streets. The use of the ground on
which it stood was given by Mr. John Walworth.</p>

<p>The fame of the company went abroad throughout the
land and invitations were received from far and near
to attend large public gatherings. In 1852 an excursion
was made by lake to Sandusky, at the request of
citizens of that place, by whom the artillerists were
handsomely entertained. In September of the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
year the anniversary of the Battle of Lundy’s Lane
was celebrated by an immense assemblage of people
with great pomp and ceremony at Niagara Falls. The
Cleveland Light Artillery, accompanied by a large
number of its friends, went by steamer to Buffalo. There
the horses were hitched to guns and caissons and the
company marched to the Falls, attracting much attention
along the route. The battery took an active part
in the celebration, dividing the honors with Major
Fay’s “crack” Buffalo company of artillery. In 1853
the Cleveland company attended by special invitation
a large encampment of the New York state militia at
Syracuse, commanded by General Swan. The battery
was warmly received and was a prominent feature of
the encampment.</p>

<p>The Ohio street armory was occupied for two or
three years when, the location being for various reasons
undesirable, it was decided to move once more.
Quarters were secured near the business center of
the city, in a brick building on Frankfort street, a
few rods west of Bank street, occupied after the war
by Montpellier’s Variety Theater. Here the battery
continued to abide until it went to the “front” in
1861.</p>

<p>At this time the company was in better condition
than ever before. In good quarters, with full battery
equipment and fine uniforms, and in an admirable
state of discipline, it was everywhere recognized as a
model organization. On February 22nd, 1856, the Light
Artillery and the Cleveland Grays, upon invitation of
the Rover Guards of Cincinnati, attended a great military
gathering in that city, to celebrate the anniversary
of Washington’s birthday. There were present a large
number of the best drilled and equipped independent
companies of Ohio and other states. None of them
surpassed the Cleveland contingent in excellence of
drill and martial bearing.</p>

<p>During the next three or four years annual encampments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
were held for practice in gunnery and field
evolutions, and in the various duties of camp life.
Frequent excursions continued to be made, in response
to invitations received from all parts of the country.
The citizens of Cleveland showed their increasing appreciation
of the high standing of the company and
the honor it had conferred upon the city by tendering
its members occasional banquets which were largely
attended, and were occasions of much social enjoyment.
These unsought recognitions were most gratifying to
the artillerymen and incited them to the utmost efforts
to “go on unto perfection.”</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind,—as a fact in the highest
degree creditable to the company—that during all this
time, embracing a period of twenty years, the large expenses
pertaining to the organization, such as the purchase
of uniforms and equipments of every kind, the
building or rental of quarters, the cost of transportation
and the employment of horses, were cheerfully
paid by the members of the company, with some assistance
from time to time by the citizens of Cleveland.
The state furnished no part of the equipment except
the guns and harness, and these only for a portion of
the time.</p>

<p>Below is given a complete roster of those whose
names were borne upon the roll of the company at
different times during these years. The names of the
nine originally detailed from the Grays to form the
Gun Squad have already been given. The list which
follows embraces all who joined and served in its
ranks from that time until the reorganization of the
battery under the militia law of Ohio. The older
residents of Cleveland and vicinity, who were familiar
with its people of thirty and forty years ago, will
recognize in this roster the names of many who are
now, or were in the past, distinguished as honorable
and public-spirited citizens, who attained high positions
in business, professional or political life. A large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
part of the old members of the Light Artillery are
now dead. A considerable number of these made the
supreme sacrifice of life upon the altar of patriotism,
during the War of the Rebellion. Some of those whose
names appear removed to other parts of the country
and rose to prominence in the various walks of
life. Some, including two of three of the detail from
the Grays in 1839, yet live in and around Cleveland,
commanding the highest respect and esteem of their
fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>These gray-haired survivors have long had an organized
association to perpetuate the memories of “auld
lang syne.” Regularly each year, on Washington’s
birthday, they meet around the social board and recall
reminiscences of the past. They hold in tender remembrance
their comrades who died for their country,
and upon the annual recurrence of Decoration Day
they never omit to strew flowers upon the graves of
those who sleep in the beautiful cemeteries of Cleveland.
The association is gradually diminishing in number, as
one by one its members yield to the infirmities of age,
but as long as any of them remain these yearly gatherings
will be continued.</p>

<p>The list of members of the old Cleveland Light Artillery
is as follows, including all whose names were on
its roll from the beginning till the reorganization under
the state law, in 1860:</p>

<p>Before entering upon the reorganization of the Artillery,
it will be fitting to pay deserved tribute to
the memory of David L. Wood, who served as its commandant
for seventeen years, and to whose zeal and
ability the company was so largely indebted for its
honorable and successful career. He was born in Litchfield
county, Connecticut, August 14, 1817. While yet
a lad his parents removed to Buffalo, where he learned
the trade of a printer. Early in 1839 he removed to
Cleveland and at once identified himself with the
Grays. His connection with Fay’s Artillery Company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
in Buffalo, his detail from the Grays as sergeant of
the Gun Squad, and his subsequent services in the
battery have already been mentioned. Under the law
passed in 1859 to organize the militia of Ohio he was
appointed by Governor Chase to the responsible position
of Quartermaster General of the state. So faithfully
and efficiently did he discharge the duties of the
position that he was reappointed by Governor Dennison
and was at the head of that most important department
of the state executive when the war broke out
in 1861. He displayed great energy and ability in
fitting for active duty the troops that so rapidly responded
to the call. But the true military spirit was
strong in him and nothing could satisfy him but active
service in the field. He resigned his position at
Columbus and having been by the President commissioned
a captain in the Eighteenth United States Infantry—“Regulars”—he
went to the front in December.
His regiment was afterward assigned to Thomas’s
corps, Army of the Cumberland. In the historic cedar
thicket at Stone River, where the Eighteenth was so
fearfully decimated, he was severely wounded. When
partially recovered he asked to be placed on such duty
as he could perform and was put in charge of a recruiting
station at Marietta, Ohio. When John Morgan
made his famous raid into Ohio, Captain Wood took
command of a hastily organized company and joined
in the pursuit of the rebel troopers, bearing an honorable
part in the action at Buffington Island. Soon after
this, although still suffering from the effects of his
wound, he applied for permission to rejoin his regiment
in the field, but it was not granted by reason of his
disability and he was placed on the retired list.</p>

<p>He went to Cleveland where he was several times
elected a Justice of the Peace. In 1876 he removed to
New York, in the hope that the climate might prove
more favorable to his failing health. He grew worse,
however, and in April 1881, he returned to Cleveland.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
He was almost immediately prostrated by severe illness,
which terminated fatally a few days later. On May 2nd
he died, sincerely mourned by a wide circle of friends,
and particularly by his old comrades of the Cleveland
Light Artillery, with whom he was so long and intimately
associated.</p>

<p>Many will remember that for two or three years before
the war, as the fast-growing sentiment against
slavery became more active and aggressive in the North,
there were mutterings that boded ill for the peace of
the nation. Those whose ears were alert heard sounds
that seemed to presage the fierce conflict that finally
burst upon the country in all its savage fury. These
“signs of the times” had the effect, everywhere, to
arouse the state authorities from their lethargy and
measures were taken to encourage and promote the
organization of military companies. In 1859 the Legislature
of Ohio passed a militia law. The friends of the
Cleveland Light Artillery had for years been hammering
at the law-givers, urging the importance of state
aid to such organizations. At last the idea found its
way into the minds of the state officials and members
of the Legislature, that an emergency might arise
when a few serviceable cannon, and trained men to
use them, would be found “mighty handy.” So in the
new law they authorized the formation of artillery
companies, each to consist of a captain, lieutenant, two
sergeants and twenty privates, with one gun and caisson.
The law further provided for the organization
of artillery regiments, each to contain not less than
six of such one-gun companies.</p>

<p>In compliance with the terms of this law the Cleveland
Artillery—four guns—was at once reorganized
into four companies, and there were added one in Brooklyn,
Cuyahoga county, and one in Geneva, Ashtabula
county. These were immediately organized into a “regiment”—though
its strength in men and guns was only
that of a single battery after things were placed upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
a war footing. The following field and staff officers
were elected and commissioned by the Governor August
1, 1860:</p>

<p class="lh">Colonel—James Barnett.</p>
<p class="lh">Lieutenant Colonel—Stephen B. Sturges.</p>
<p class="lh">Major—Clark S. Gates.</p>
<p class="lh">Surgeon—C. E. Ames.</p>
<p class="lh">Quartermaster—Amos Townsend.</p>
<p class="lh">Quartermaster-Sergeant—Randall Crawford.</p>

<p>The companies of the regiment were commended as
follows:</p>

<p class="lh">Company A, Cleveland—W. R. Simmonds.</p>
<p class="lh">Company B, Cleveland—John Mack.</p>
<p class="lh">Company C, Brooklyn—J. S. Andrews.</p>
<p class="lh">Company D, Cleveland—P. W. Rice.</p>
<p class="lh">Company E, Cleveland—Louis Heckman.</p>
<p class="lh">Company F, Geneva—Dennis Kenny.</p>


<p>The organization was officially designated as the
“First Regiment of Light Artillery, Third Brigade,
Fourth Division, Ohio Volunteer Militia.”</p>

<p>The first public appearance of the newly born “regiment”
was at the unveiling of the statue of Commodore
Perry, in Cleveland, September 10th, 1860. The occasion
was an imposing one, and a number of military
companies from abroad were present and participated
in the parade, notably organizations from Rhode Island,
which was Commodore Perry’s native state. The visiting
troops and distinguished guests accompanying them
were hospitably entertained during their stay in Cleveland
by the members and friends of the Artillery and
the Grays. A few months later the pomp and glory
of a holiday pageant were exchanged for the stern
realities of “grim visaged war,” and the guns of the
Cleveland Light Artillery were hurling shot and shell
into the ranks of the rebels south of the Ohio River.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln was elected President in the fall of 1860.
As the political campaign of that year progressed the
result was foreshadowed by the strong drift of public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
sentiment at the North. The “fire-eaters” of the South
wrought themselves into a high state of excitement
over their prospective defeat and for a month before
the contest was decided made lurid threats of secession
and revolution in such a contingency. The northern
people were slow to believe that these declarations
were anything more than “wind.” Even when they
began to take definite form, after the election, the number
was yet small who believed there would be a conflict
of arms.</p>

<p>The success of the Republican party in the election
was made the pretext for the great revolt. Six weeks
later South Carolina packed her knapsack and marched
out of the Union. Six other states followed closely
upon her heels, and in a short time four more. Beaten
at the ballot-box they determined to try the cartridge-box,
but—as those most interested in this volume will
remember, for they helped to make it so—this experiment
was equally unsatisfactory to them in its outcome.</p>

<p>By the time the “cotton” states began to secede, and
the people of the South to show great activity in the
organization of military companies, the impression became
quite general throughout the North that the situation
was critical and there was serious trouble ahead—and
not very far ahead, either. The great “coming
event” of the century was “casting its shadow before.”
Every day but strengthened and intensified the determination,
through the great, loyal North, that at all
hazards the Union should be preserved and the flag protected
from dishonor.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1860, months before the North
was aroused by the mighty reveille that sounded amidst
the echoes of Sumter, many independent companies then
existing made a voluntary offer of their services, provided
they should be needed. Among the first to show
a desire to “get there” early and secure front seats was
the Cleveland six-gun “regiment” of artillery. As soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
as there began to be a smell of powder in the air the
members of this organization promptly developed an
appetite for war. They sent to the Adjutant General
of Ohio a fervid communication tendering their services
and stating that they might be depended upon to respond
instantly to the call of duty. In two or three
days an answer was received. The Adjutant General
commended their patriotism in the highest terms, and
in the name of the state thanked them effusively for
their noble offer, but added that he had no idea they
would be called upon, <em>as it was not at all probable
that any cavalry or artillery would be required</em>! No
doubt this official’s views soon underwent a most radical
change. But his depressing letter had the effect of
the proverbial “wet blanket” upon the more enthusiastic
artillerists, who were beginning to actually suffer for
a scrimmage. They were afraid it wasn’t going to be
“much of a shower,” after all! Nobody will say that
during the ensuing four years there was not enough
to go around; everybody who wanted any of it had
abundant opportunity to supply himself. But after
the Cleveland boys heard from the Adjutant General
some of them really mourned over the prospect of “getting
left.”</p>

<span class="smcap fs70 lh">A Prompt Response to War’s Alarms and the Artillery
Goes to the Front.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>At half past four o’clock on the morning of Friday—unlucky
day—April 12, 1861, the rebel batteries at
Charleston opened fire on Fort Sumter. The fort was
surrendered at noon of Sunday, April 14. On this day
President Lincoln drafted his proclamation calling
out seventy-five thousand volunteers for three months.
That night it went out by telegraph, and on Monday
the people of the North knew that the last hope of
compromise had vanished. Already the “dogs of war”
had been slipped, and the country was to be tested in
the fierce crucible of a mighty conflict. None who
witnessed it, or were a part of it, can ever forget the
grand, patriotic uprising of the loyal masses, from
Maine to California, and from the Lakes to the Ohio
river, to avenge the insult of the National Flag. It
need only be alluded to in this connection. The quotas
of the various states under the first call for troops
were duly apportioned, and in some cases were more
than filled in a single day. All the organized military
companies in Ohio offered their services, and all were
clamorous that they should be accepted. There seemed
to be a generally prevailing fear that the war would
be “all over” before they could get there.</p>

<p>The Cleveland Grays—from which the first gun squad
of the Cleveland Artillery was detailed more than
twenty years before—left amidst prodigious excitement
for Columbus, became Company E of the First Ohio
Infantry, and started immediately for Washington. But
so far there was no call for the artillery. How all the
men, from Colonel to powder-monkey, chafed in the
impatience of their raging patriotism. It would be
sad indeed, they thought, if, after all, it should prove
that the Adjutant General was right, and that “no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
artillery would be needed”—or if a few cannon should
be required the batteries of the Regular Army would
supply them, and the unhappy volunteers would remain
“out in the cold.”</p>

<p>But there came a loud call for artillery, and the boys,
who were fretting themselves sick, had not long to
wait for the glad summons. On Saturday, April 20,
the following dispatch went singing over the wires:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right lh">Columbus, O., April 20, 1861.</p>

<p class="no-indent lh">To Colonel James Barnett,</p>
<p class="lh">Cleveland, O.</p>

<p>Report your six pieces, caissons and full battery,
including Geneva company, at Columbus forthwith—Monday
if possible. You can hire horses for the guns
here or at your point of service. Bring harness and
everything else, and twenty men to each gun. You
retain Colonel’s rank. By order—</p>

<p class="right">H. B. Carrington,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Adjutant General.</p>
</div>

<p>This was received by Colonel Barnett early in the
evening of the day named. How the news spread
through the city, as if borne upon the wings of the
wind! How it set the hearts of the impatient boys
to thumping and how they cheered at the tidings,
while tears dimmed the eyes and moistened the cheeks
of wives and mothers and sisters and sweethearts!</p>

<p>Early Sunday morning Colonel Barnett issued the
following order to captains of companies:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You will report your command of twenty men ready
to march to Columbus tomorrow at 12 o’clock, noon, at
the Public Square. You will have your piece and
caisson and harness complete at the depot between
Superior street and Vineyard lane, with a detail of
ten men to attend to their embarkation, at 9 o’clock A.
M., under the command of a sergeant, and when embarked
report to your superior officers.</p>

<p>By order of the Adjutant General of Ohio.</p>

<p class="right">James Barnett,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Colonel First Regiment Artillery,<br>
S. B. Sturges, Lieutenant Colonel.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>A messenger was hurried out to Brooklyn to stir
up that company, and a telegram was sent to Geneva,
carrying the news to Company F.</p>

<p>“Ah, then and there was hurrying to and fro,” as
the artillerymen hustled around, engaged in hasty preparation
for “going to war.” In Cleveland, as everywhere
else, there was a furious ferment of excitement. For
the moment business of every kind was laid aside. The
one absorbing theme was the opening conflict. Husbands
and sons and brothers had been called to the
field to defend the nation’s flag. Not only their immediate
friends but the citizens generally put forth
every possible effort to fit out the boys in good shape.
Meetings were held and fervid speeches were made.
But no stimulating force was then necessary, for every
heart was swelling with patriotic ardor and the spirit
of sacrifice. It was not a good time for the utterance
of “copperhead” sentiments. Had any one dared to
express sympathy with those who had fired on the flag
his life would not have been worth a rush. If there
were any such, they kept prudently quiet. People
shouted and sang patriotic songs, and spoke words
of cheer and encouragement to those who were about
to leave for “the front.” The boys had little need,
however, of being urged to obey the call of duty, and
sympathy was wasted on them, for they were in a state
of feverish anxiety for an opportunity to unlimber their
guns in the face of the foe.</p>

<p>The state of public feeling was about as hot as it
could be, but on Sunday morning another dispatch
was received which added more fuel to the fierce
flames and raised the temperature to even a higher point.
It was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
Columbus, O., April 21, 1861.</p>
<p class="no-indent">To Colonel James Barnett,</p>

<p>Can you bring your command here tonight instead of
waiting till tomorrow? If so, come armed.</p>

<p class="right">
William Dennison, Governor.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>Thus early people began to learn that there is “no
Sunday in war.” All that day the excitement increased.
Those who took the time to go to church listened to
sermons on the duty of the hour.</p>

<p>It was found impracticable to assemble the regiment
in time to get away on Sunday and the Governor was
informed by telegraph that it would leave early Monday
morning. A dispatch from Capt. Dennis Kenny at
Geneva told that Company F was “red hot” and
could be ready to leave that night for the rendezvous at
Cleveland. The necessary transportation was provided
and the company reported before daylight. Company C.
from Brooklyn, was equally prompt to respond, and
half the people of that town accompanied the boys to
the city to “see them off.”</p>

<p>During the forenoon of Monday—April 22d—there
was the greatest activity among the members and
friends of the regiment. The whole city was astir and
fairly boiling with excitement. Thousands of people
turned out, thronging the depot and the railroad leading
to Columbus, to witness the departure of the soldiers.
The latter were, of course, only provided with a “pick
up” outfit, it being expected that all necessary clothing
and supplies would be furnished by the state authorities.</p>

<p>In order to start the boys in as comfortable shape
as possible the citizens contributed a sum sufficient for
the purchase of one hundred and twenty blankets—all
that could be found in Cleveland suitable for military
use. The blankets were bought by Mr. Henry N. Johnson,
and the following memorandum of the purchases
is given as an item of interest:</p>

<p>At about noon the regiment, numbering in all about
one hundred and sixty men, embarked on a special
train. There were hasty and tearful farewells and
the train moved off amidst tempestuous shouts and
cheers, the waving of flags and kerchiefs and the music
of brass bands.</p>

<p>At that time no one had more than a vague and
foggy idea of what war was. It had not yet become the
serious matter that it was a few months later, and
during the four long and bitter years that followed.
The first volunteers went to the field with a grand
hurrah, impelled by motives of the truest patriotism,
but with no conception of the hardship and privation
and blood and fire and death that were before them.
The sickle was sharpened but had not been thrust in
to reap its ghastly harvest. As yet there were no
stretchers nor hospitals nor ambulances freighted with
mangled victims; no miles of reddened earth strewed
with the dead and dying; no long, weary marches,
through heat and cold and storm; no ravages of wasting
disease. All these were yet as an unopened book
to these men hastening to the field, and to those who
with moistened eyes and beating hearts bade them
farewell and God speed. Only a few then believed that
there would be much of a war—that the trouble would
not all be over in sixty or ninety days.</p>

Cleveland, the officers of the field and staff having been

<p>It may be remarked here in passing that the men
were not long in learning that there was something in
“soldiering” besides romance and “flowery beds of ease.”
Before June 1st six or seven of them had been discharged
for disability by reason of sickness, and one
made up his mind that he had got all he wanted and
deserted.</p>

<p>All the way to Columbus the boys sang and laughed
and shouted in the exuberance of their patriotic emotions,
and told one another of the valorous deeds they
would perform as soon as opportunity was afforded
them. At all points along the route the people greeted
them with uproarious cheers. Wherever the train halted
the guns and caissons, which were on platform cars,
were regarded with the utmost curiosity and interest
by crowds of men, women and children. The engines
of war were a novelty to them.</p>

<p>On reaching the state capital—where it had been supposed
that the regiment would debark and go into camp
for a few days at least—an order was received to proceed
at once to Marietta, Ohio, by way of Loveland.
It was thought that Marietta was in jeopardy, being
threatened by rebel forces in Virginia. All the infantry
companies from that part of the state which had offered
their services had been sent to Washington. The
city was wholly defenseless and there were no troops to
send there except the Cleveland artillery regiment.
After something had been learned of the art of war it
came to be considered the proper thing to always provide
an infantry support for artillery, but nobody
thought of such things at the moment of emergency.
So the hundred and sixty fledglings from Cleveland,
with their guns and caissons, but without a single horse
to move them, were hurried away to prevent the rebels
from capturing Marietta. It is but justice to the members
of the regiment to say that they had an abiding
confidence in their ability to hold that city against the
entire Southern Confederacy. As the train went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
whirling on through the darkness all hearts were swelling
with patriotism and a heroic determination to obey
every call of duty, even to facing death in its most awful
form upon the battlefield. They expected to commence
wading in blood immediately.</p>

<p>Marietta was reached early next morning but no
enemy was there to fight. The air was full of wild
rumors that legions of rebels were approaching, with
evil designs upon the city, and the people were badly
scared. The arrival of the Cleveland artillery, with real
cannon, had a reassuring effect upon the citizens. The
men were most cordially welcomed and received with
unbounded hospitality. The regiment went into camp
on the fair grounds, placing the guns in position to
command the city and spread havoc and destruction
among any misguided people who should attempt to
capture it.</p>

<p>The regiment had as yet received nothing whatever in
the way of supplies from either the state or national
government. Indeed the men had not even been
mustered into the service—and as a matter of fact they
were not until three months later. Immediate requisitions
were made upon the authorities at Columbus, by
mail and telegraph, for clothing, rations, ammunition,
etc., all of which were quite indispensable to efficient
service. When ordered on from Columbus Colonel
Barnett had been assured that everything needful would
be forwarded at once, but the supplies did not come, nor
was the slightest attention paid to the requisitions. The
Cleveland contingent seemed to have been entirely forgotten.
It was a pretty clear case of “out of sight out
of mind.” There may have been some excuse for this
in the fact that the call to arms had come suddenly and
found the state wholly unprepared for such an emergency;
nor had there been sufficient time as yet for
the United States government to adjust itself to a condition
of actual war and provide for the needs of its
soldiers. The state authorities no doubt did the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
they could, but in the hurry of raising troops and rushing
them to the front in the shortest possible time
everything was in the wildest chaos. It is little wonder
that things went at haphazard and it was only by chance
that any officer got for his men what they needed.</p>

<p>As day after day passed and no answer to the requisitions
came both officers and men began to get a little
warm under the collar. Colonel Barnett prodded up the
Columbus people daily, his messages growing more and
more pungent and emphatic. The artillery had not been
provided with a single horse and would have been of
little practical value in case of an attack, unless the
rebels had kindly marched up in front of the guns and
permitted themselves to be shot down. In this case the
slaughter would have been fearful, had the boys been
supplied with effective ammunition. When the regiment
passed through Columbus the condition of the command
was reported and the Adjutant General had promised
that horses and ammunition should be promptly furnished
at Marietta. As a starter he put into the baggage-car,
before leaving the state capital, several pork
barrels full of round shot, a few chests of fine rifle
powder and a lot of linsey-woolsey stuff, ostensibly for
the purpose of making cartridges. The whole “outfit”
was entirely worthless. The shot did not fit the guns
and the powder was no doubt a good thing with which
to go squirrel hunting, but was little better than so
much sawdust for artillery use. It will be readily understood
that at this time the Cleveland Light Artillery
was not in condition to do any overwhelming damage
to the Southern Confederacy.</p>

<p>The men had no clothing except that which they
had brought from home. Few had a change of garments,
as it was understood when they left Cleveland that they
would be amply supplied. They could rub along a while
with what clothes they had but they must have “grub”—that
was in the nature of a prime and fundamental
necessity. Patriotism was a good thing as far as it went,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
but it didn’t go a long way in satisfying the cravings
of an empty stomach. Appeals to the authorities were
in vain and so Colonel Barnett entered into a contract
with a man named Hall, of Marietta, to “board” the
command. There was nothing else to be done, and it
is just to the authorities to say that this bill was finally
allowed and paid by the state. It is also fair to Mr.
Hall to say that he carried out his contract in good faith,
furnishing plenty of food which allowed small margin
for grumbling.</p>

<p>The camp of the artillery in the fair grounds was
named “Camp Putnam,” in honor of an old and patriotic
citizen of Marietta who was a direct descendant of Gen.
Israel Putnam—“Old Put”—of Revolutionary fame. The
men fixed up their quarters in a style that a year or two
later would have been considered luxurious in the extreme.
The kindness and hospitality of the citizens
were conspicuous. No effort was spared to make the
boys as comfortable as possible. But even under these
favorable conditions some of the boys imagined that they
were having a hard time of it and were suffering a good
deal for their country. When they came to experience
the real hardships of active service in the field they
looked back with unutterable yearnings to the idle weeks
that were largely spent in playing euchre and “old
sledge” at Camp Putnam.</p>

<p>Colonel Barnett was in command of the camp and
of the post of Marietta. He enforced the strictest discipline
and daily drills rapidly increased the efficiency
of the command. Early efforts were made to secure a
supply of better ammunition, as that hastily picked up
at Columbus was of no value whatever. There were
no shells or canister, and the solid shot were not only
wrong in size but they were not round and could not
have been thrown with any degree of precision. Colonel
Barnett telegraphed to Cincinnati and secured a quantity
of shot that was promptly forwarded. He engaged
the use of a shop in Marietta where a lathe was put to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
work turning sabots, and a laboratory was fitted up
where cartridges were made and the sabots were properly
strapped to the shot. Nearly all this work was performed
by the members of the regiment. Many of them
were excellent mechanics and all were intelligent and
willing. Such men can do anything. The ladies of
Marietta offered their services, glad of the opportunity to
do something for the cause of the Union. Since the first
tocsin of war they had been busy in scraping lint and
preparing bandages, until the supply seemed to be greatly
in excess of the immediate demand—for scarcely anybody
had been hurt yet, and a million or two of women
all over the North had been engaged in the work. Now
there was a chance for the matrons and maidens of
Marietta to render assistance in another very practical
way. A bountiful supply of red flannel was procured
and immediately a hundred fair hands were at work,
plying scissors and needle, in making cartridge-bags.
The ladies made a “bee” of it, and in a wonderfully
short time they had finished enough to last for months.
The fine rifle powder that was pitched on the train at
Columbus was exchanged for cannon powder, and the
artillery began to look more like business. This homemade
ammunition was largely used in target practice,
which was deemed highly essential to future usefulness.
Day after day the air resounded with the roar of artillery,
as the boys sighted their guns at the targets and
imagined themselves hurling the whistling missiles
through solid battalions of rebels.</p>

<p>It was nearly a month before any supplies of clothing
and camp and garrison equipage were received.
About the middle of May, Captain O. M. Poe, of the Corps
of Engineers, United States Army, was sent by Gen.
George B. McClellan to inspect the Cleveland Light Artillery
with a view to its being ready for service, at a
moment’s notice. Capt. Poe expressed himself as greatly
pleased with the command and the drill, discipline and
soldierly bearing of its members. He assured Colonel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
Barnett that it should be thoroughly equipped without
further delay. There seemed good reason to hope that at
length there would be something besides mere promises.
A few days later this was partially realized by the arrival
of a quantity of clothing, which made the men
feel more like soldiers, even though it was shoddy—and
very poor shoddy at that. It is a fact that the
garments were of such poor stuff that a week or two
of wear was sufficient to finish them. They had to be
thrown aside out of a decent regard for the usages and
proprieties of civilized people. While wearing these
clothes the men would break for their quarters and hide
themselves if ladies entered the camp. There also came
a lot of kettles, pans, and camp utensils of various kinds.
These were heartily welcomed, as the boys had been
forced to make all sorts of shifts, with such articles as
were kindly furnished them by the people of Marietta.</p>

<p>About this time another idea appears to have effected
a lodgment in the minds of the authorities at Columbus,
and that was that horses were quite essential for field
artillery. A stirring up by Gen. McClellan caused a
dispatch to be sent to Col. Barnett, authorizing and directing
him to proceed at once to mount the regiment—or
“battery,” as it was termed, for such only it really
was—by purchasing horses in the vicinity of Marietta.
A day later came the following, which will be of interest
as a relic of the early days of the war:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">Adjutant General’s Office,</p>
<p class="right">Columbus, May 25, 1861.</p>
<p class="no-indent">Special Order No. 244.</p>

<p>Col. James Barnett: Upon receipt of this order, if you
have not previously acted upon telegram sent this evening,
you will purchase for your battery 76 horses, upon
the best terms you can, putting them under the best
discipline for prompt action.</p>

<p>From advices received from Judge Putnam it is expected
that you can purchase for a sum not to exceed
from 75 to 110 dollars each. The army limit I understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>

times, unless in special cases. Consult the citizens to

</div>

<p>To enable Colonel Barnett to carry out this order the
sum of $10,000 was placed to his credit by the State of
Ohio, in a Marietta bank, out of which the horses were
to be paid for as fast as purchased. On the same day
the above order was received, came also the following
telegram, which threw Camp Putnam into a quiver of
excitement and caused a wild rush into the region round
about to look for horses:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">Headquarters Dep’t of the Ohio,</p>
<p class="right">Cincinnati, May 26, 1861.</p>
<p class="no-indent">To Col. Barnett:</p>

me when ready for service.</p>

<p class="right">
G. B. McCLELLAN,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Major General U. S. A.</p>
</div>

<p>Six or eight of the best judges of horseflesh in the
battery were immediately sent out to scour the country.
Whenever a suitable animal was found that could be
bought at a fair price an order upon Colonel Barnett
was given by the buyer to the seller, stating briefly the
sort of animal purchased and the price that had been
agreed upon. These orders were promptly paid by
Colonel Barnett with checks upon the bank. A few
sample orders are given below. They were written on
cards, leaves torn from memorandum books and odd
bits of paper of every variety of size, shape and color:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="blockquot">

</p>

<p>Please pay Wm. Lamb one hundred and sixty dollars

</p>
</div>

<p>These orders, besides being of historical interest, go
to show that correct orthography is not essential to the
purest and loftiest patriotism. The “mairs” for which
the last order was given were accepted, although of the
wrong sex to comply with army regulations, which requires
that horses purchased for the cavalry and artillery
service shall be of the masculine gender. Only
males, of the equine as well as the human race, are considered
to be fit for war.</p>

<p>Within two days the required number of horses was
obtained. All hands were busy “breaking them in” to
their new sphere of usefulness. Trained horses are only
second in value to trained men for artillery service.
When it comes to “standing fire” there is as much difference
in horses as there is in men. Some animals appear
to have a plentiful supply of “sand” and display
an intelligent courage that is almost heroic, while others
become sadly demoralized under fire and are totally unmanageable.</p>

<p>Meantime the air was full of rumors of projected campaigns
into the enemy’s country in which the Cleveland
Light Artillery was to participate. Something fresh in
this line was circulated through the camp every hour.
No two of these “grape vines”—as the boys learned later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
to call them—were alike, and they sufficed to keep everybody
in a state of furious agitation. The artillerymen had
a consuming desire to do something that would help to
put down the rebellion. Like all new troops, at every
stage of the war, they were impressed with the idea that
their mission was to fight somebody, and they chafed at
the weeks of inactivity in camp. While it might not be
strictly true to say that any of them were anxious to
test the truth of the somewhat apocryphal statement
that “it is sweet to die for one’s country,” it may safely
be recorded that they were eager to go on the war-path,
and as to the rest they were willing to take the
chances. An order to move was daily expected and the
utmost activity prevailed in the work of getting everything
in perfect readiness to respond at once to the
summons.</p>

<p>By this time an infantry force had reached Marietta,
consisting of the Fourteenth Ohio Volunteers, Colonel
James B. Steadman, and the Eighteenth Ohio Volunteers,
Colonel T. R. Stanley. The Fourteenth had been drilling
for three weeks at Camp Tayler, in Cleveland. It came
with full ranks, completely armed and equipped for
service. The Eighteenth had not yet received arms and
equipments, but these were promised at an early day.
In those days a regiment of infantry meant a thousand
men, and not a mere skeleton of two or three hundred,
such as were common later in the war, when the ranks
had been decimated by disease and the deadly storm of
battle. The Fourteenth Ohio reached Marietta on the
24th of May and the Eighteenth on the following day.</p>

<p>The rumors of forward movements at length assumed
definite form. It became known that a campaign was
about to begin across the river in Western Virginia. On
May 27th the following dispatch was received:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
Cincinnati, Ohio, May 27, 1861.</p>
<p class="no-indent">To Col. Barnett:</p>

<p>Upon the requisition of Col. Steadman you will supply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
him with a detachment of two guns, with the proper officers
and men.</p>

<p class="right">G. B. McCLELLAN,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Major General.</p>
</div>

<p>On this day the Fourteenth Ohio Infantry went by boat
to Parkersburg, Virginia—the state of West Virginia
had not then been formed—being the first Union force
to occupy that place. Col. Steadman took possession
without meeting any opposition worthy of mention. It
was now reasonably certain that the artillery would
very soon follow to take part in the campaign. Every
man was directed to hold himself ready to be up and
away at a moment’s notice.</p>

</div>

<p>Picturesque dreams of mighty conflicts and fields of
glory disturbed the slumbers of those in Camp Putnam
during the night of May 27th. Nor were they far out of
the way, for before another sunset, part of the artillery
would be en route for “the front.” Early on the morning
of the 28th a telegraph messenger handed to Colonel Barnett
a dispatch which read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">Parkersburg Va., May 28, 1861.</p>
<p class="no-indent">To Col. Barnett:</p>

<p>Send immediately to this place two companies of
artillery, with their pieces, horses, and three hundred
rounds of ammunition.</p>

<p class="right">JAMES B. STEADMAN,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Colonel Fourteenth Reg’t, O. V. M.</p>
</div>

<p>Colonel Barnett answered this telegram, informing
Colonel Steadman that the battery was entirely destitute
of ammunition for field service. A supply was hourly
expected and upon its arrival the detachment would be
sent forward with all possible dispatch. In the afternoon
Colonel Steadman replied as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">Parkersburg. Va., May 28. 1861.</p>
<p class="no-indent">To Col. Barnett:</p>

<p>If you can send two of your companies with their
pieces do so at once. The presence of the men and guns
will have a good effect. Send forward as many of the
Eighteenth Ohio Infantry as are armed and equipped.
I want them to garrison this place. These are General
McClellan’s instructions.</p>

<p class="right">JAMES B. STEADMAN,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Col. Com’d Fourteenth Ohio.</p>
</div>

<p>During this day there was a fusillade of telegrams
from all sources, among which were the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">Cincinnati, Ohio, May 28, 1861.</p>
<p class="no-indent">To Col. Barnett:</p>

<p>Two hundred rounds of solid shot and one hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
rounds of canister will be shipped to you from Columbus
this evening. As soon as you receive it detach two
pieces with an officer and complement of men with ammunition
to go forward and report to Col. Steadman at
the burned bridge on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
beyond Parkersburg.</p>

<p class="right">G. B. McCLELLAN,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Major General.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">Columbus, Ohio, May 28, 1861.</p>
<p class="no-indent">To Col. Barnett:</p>

<p>Obey implicitly every order from General McClellan.

of all your movements. Clothing and supplies go
by your Quartermaster.</p>

<p class="right">H. B. CARRINGTON,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Adjutant General.</p>
</div>

<p>These telegrams kept the members of the Battery in a
continual fever of excitement, which grew hotter every
hour. In reply to Colonel Steadman’s second dispatch
Colonel Barnett telegraphed him the substance of General
McClellan’s dispatch, and informed him that the two
companies would go forward the next day. Camp Putnam
was greatly disturbed by the question as to which
two of the six companies should constitute this detachment.
All were eager to go, apparently saddened by the
thought that this, their first, might be their last, and
only chance to get an experimental knowledge of what
war was. The military career of the four companies
which stayed behind would terminate in an inglorious
journey home, the war over and no laurels crowning
their brows. Colonel Barnett selected Companies D,
Captain Rice, and F, Captain Kenny, as the fortunate
ones. They were ordered to be ready to embark early on
the following day. The detachment was placed in command
of Lieutenant-Colonel Sturges.</p>

<p>The ammunition arrived early next morning. Companies
D and F, with their guns, horses, and equipments
complete, were soon on board a special steamboat and left
in high spirits, replying with great gusts to the parting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
cheers of their chopfallen comrades who remained. On
reaching Parkersburg, May 29—11 p. m., about twelve
miles down the river from Marietta, it was found that
Colonel Steadman, to whom Lieutenant-Colonel Sturges
had been ordered to report with the detachment, had advanced
some distance beyond that place on the line of the
Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, where his command was engaged
in repairing bridges which the retreating enemy
had destroyed. The artillery detachment pushed on
promptly and joined him May 30—12 M. At last they
were on the “sacred soil” of a seceded state, ready to send
the echoes of their guns reverberating among the Virginia
hills. The Fourteenth Ohio boys gave the artillerymen
a rousing reception, greeting them with loud and
oft-repeated cheers.</p>

<p>At this time Colonel George A. Porterfield was in command
of the rebel forces in that part of Virginia, with
his headquarters at Grafton. The loyal sentiment in
Western Virginia was very strong. Those who favored
secession were in a decided minority. It was deemed
of the highest importance to the Union cause to occupy
the territory as fast and as securely as possible, thus affording
encouragement and protection to the loyal people
and holding that section from being dragged into the
vortex of rebellion, clearly against the will of the great
majority of the people.</p>

<p>The Confederate authorities were equally anxious to
retain possession to recruit their armies, secure the
supplies which the country afforded, and bring every possible
influence to bear upon the people to induce them to
cast their fortunes with the South. To this end Colonel
Porterfield, upon assuming command a few days prior
to Steadman’s occupation of Parkersburg, had issued a
high-flown proclamation to the people of Western Virginia.
In sounding phrase he called upon them to stand
by their state and urged them to fill up the Confederate
ranks and assist in protecting their firesides from the
ravage of the invader. He assured them that not a foot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
of Virginia soil should be surrendered to the hated
“Yankees,” though it took every drop of blood in his
veins. A few days later he and such of his soldiers as
were not killed or captured were leaving tracks behind
them with the utmost diligence, in their efforts to escape
from their blue-coated pursuers.</p>

<p>General McClellan was in command of all the Union
forces in that department. He planned the campaign
and directed the movements that were so successful during
the early days of the war. The services rendered by
the three months’ men in Western Virginia were of inestimable
value to the government, even though the
amount of blood actually shed on either side was not
large when compared with the copious streams that reddened
the earth before the war was finished. The
“battles” of those days would have ranked only as
skirmishes when the great conflict was at its height,
when mighty armies met and thousands upon thousands
were slain or wounded in a single day. But history has
justly given an enduring fame to those who sprang to
arms at the first call, and by their promptness and gallantry
saved Western Virginia to the Union. In this
campaign the Cleveland Light Artillery bore a most
honorable part and deserved the high praise which was
so freely accorded to it.</p>

<p>The force under Colonel Steadman, including the detachment
of the Cleveland Light Artillery, advanced
rapidly along the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, moving
by train with occasional stops for the repair of bridges
and culverts. With such celerity was this accomplished
that on June 1—4 a. m., Clarksburg was reached,
about eighty miles east of Parkersburg. There
was occasional skirmishing on the way, and a few prisoners
were picked up, but no action of moment took place.
The enemy retreated at all points before the advance
of the Union force. On May 30th Grafton was occupied,
without loss of life, by a force under Colonel B. F. Kelley,
First Virginia (Union) Volunteers, which made a rapid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
movement from Wheeling and secured a safe lodgment
at this important point. The rebels evacuated in mad
haste upon its approach.</p>

<p>The rebel forces which had been driven out of Clarksburg
and Grafton fell back to Philippi, some thirty miles
south of Grafton. Here they made a stand and announced
their determination to fight. It was at once
decided to give them an opportunity to do so. An immediate
advance of the Union forces upon that place was
ordered. It was desirable to again strike the enemy
before he should have time to fortify and otherwise
strengthen his position. The rebel commander was calling
loudly for reinforcements and it was deemed of
the utmost importance to keep him on the run before his
force should be so augmented as to outnumber the Union
troops. The greatest energy was displayed in the movement
on Philippi. Steadman, with five companies of the
Fourteenth Ohio Infantry and Companies D and F of
the Cleveland Artillery, was ordered by rail to Webster,
within 12 miles of Grafton, and the nearest point to
Philippi. To reach the latter, a rapid march of fifteen
miles was to be made. Steadman’s command moved
from Clarksburg to Webster on the 2nd of June. Artillery
in command of Lieutenant-Colonel S. B. Sturges. At
the same time another column was advancing on Philippi
from Grafton, under Colonel Kelley. The whole expedition
was in command of Brigadier-General T. A. Morris,
Colonel Lamb acting as staff officer for General
McClellan.</p>

<p>It is now necessary to go back to Marietta and see
what has become of the four companies of the artillery
which remained grumbling in Camp Putnam when
Lieutenant-Colonel Sturges went with the detachment to
join Steadman. The impatient patriots did not have long
to wait. One more night in camp, and then came a summons
that electrified them. The four companies, with all
the goods, chattels and other appurtenances thereto belonging,
embarked on a steamboat and went with all speed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
to Benwood, on the Virginia side of the river opposite
Bellaire, and not far from Wheeling. The trip of sixty-five
miles was made in a few hours and the happy Clevelanders
set their feet for the first time within the confines
of Dixie’s Land. Barnett reported to General Morris
and was directed to move his command at once by
rail to Grafton, where the four guns were attached to
the column to be led by Kelley in the advance upon
Philippi. The infantry force consisted of portions of
Kelley’s regiment, the First Virginia, the North Indiana,
Colonel Milroy, and the Sixteenth Ohio, Colonel Irvine.
This column was ordered by rail to Thornton, a few miles
east of Grafton, from which point the march to Philippi
was to be made. The route was four or five miles longer
than that to be traversed by the co-operating force to
advance from Webster.</p>

<p>General Morris said in his order to Colonel Kelley prescribing
the details of the movement, dated Grafton,
June 2d, 1861: You must regulate your march according
to your own discretion, and your bivouac or rest at
night in such manner that you are sure of coming before
the town of Philippi as near 4 o’clock tomorrow morning
as possible. Should you this evening receive certain
information that the rebels have retreated eastward
from Philippi, you will make the resting time of your
troops as short as possible, in order to follow them up
with all the speed the strength of your troops will allow.</p>

<p>The right attacking column was under the command
of Colonel Dumont, Seventh Indiana Volunteers, to
which the force of Steadman had been joined, with part
of the Sixth Indiana, Colonel Crittenden. The following
is the order of General Morris to Colonel Dumont:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">Headquarters U. S. Volunteers,</p>

<p class="right">Grafton, W. Va., June 2, 1861.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Colonel Dumont,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comdg. Seventh Reg’t Indiana Vols., near Grafton,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Va.:</span></p>

<p>Colonel: You will proceed by railroad this evening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
at 8:30 o’clock to Webster with eight companies of your
regiment. At Webster you will be Joined by Colonel
Steadman with five companies of his regiment and two
field pieces of Ohio artillery, also by Colonel Crittenden
with six companies of his regiment. From Webster you
will, with this command, march on Philippi, using your
own discretion in the conduct of the march, keeping in
view that you should arrive in front of the town at 4
o’clock precisely tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>Information is received that the rebels are in some
force at Philippi. The object of your column will be to
divert attention until the attack is made by Colonel
Kelley, and should resistance be offered you are to aid
him to the extent of your ability. In the conduct of your
column you must use your discretion, being governed
by such circumstances as may occur. When joined by
Colonel Kelley the whole force will be under his command.</p>

<p>The companies of your command will take two full
days’ rations. Should you receive instructions from
Colonel Kelley that the rebels have retreated, you will
join him at once and act under his command.</p>

<p>By command of Brigadier-General T. A. Morris:</p>

<p class="right">JOHN A. STEIN.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Acting Assistant Adjutant General.</p>
</div>

<p>The intention was to surprise the rebels and the
movement was admirably planned and carried out to
effect this result. This force, leaving after dark, had
reasonable assurance of reaching the enemy in advance
of any information from their friends and, as events
proved, did so. The advance was favored by the extreme
darkness of the night and a continuous fall of rain.
These circumstances contributed in no small degree to
the complete success of the expedition, but they were
rough enough on the raw soldiers who made their first
march under such dismal conditions.</p>

<p>All night, through the darkness and drenching rain,
the two columns pushed on, over roads so rough and
muddy that they were in some places almost impassable
to artillery. It was only by the aid of the men who
swarmed around the carriages and put their hands to the
wheels, that the panting horses were able to drag guns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
and caissons. To the volunteers, that night was a baptism
indeed. They tried bravely to keep up their spirits as
they trudged along through mud and water and stumbled
over the roots and stumps and stones that lay in their
pathway. It was so dark that a man could scarcely see
his file leader. That nocturnal experience knocked the
poetry and romance out of “soldiering” with a suddenness
and completeness that was paralyzing. Most of
these men “followed the flag” during the long years of
war. They passed through many such unspeakably
wretched nights and days, but nothing afterward seemed
to equal in misery those weary hours of floundering
through the mire, with benumbed limbs and soaked and
dripping garments during that night march to Philippi.</p>

<p>There was no postponement of the engagement on
account of the weather, and promptly at the appointed
hour, 4 a. m., the two columns were in communication
before the town. Like most of the so-called “towns” in
the South in those days, it wasn’t much of a place,
though the county seat of Barbour county. It had a
shabby courthouse, a still more shabby hotel, a few
houses in which the Philippians lived, and a name—that
was all.</p>

<p>The necessary dispositions for an attack were promptly
and carefully made, with the object of capturing the
entire rebel force, whatever it might be. At daylight
the troops, which had nearly surrounded the town in
order to “let no guilty man escape,” closed in from different
directions to spring the trap that had been set.
The early morning visitation was a complete surprise
to the rebels. There were a few sleepy pickets posted
at isolated points, several of which were taken in before
they had fairly got their eyes open. At length a few of
them sufficiently collected their scattered wits to fire off
their guns and then break for the town. This alarmed
the main body of the Confederate forces and in an instant
the direst confusion prevailed. Colonel Porterfield
and his staff had their headquarters at the hotel and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
were yet asleep when the alarm was given. Hastily
throwing on their clothes they quickly mounted their
horses and dashed around endeavoring to learn what the
trouble was all about.</p>

<p>The Union forces pressed rapidly forward on the heels
of the retreating pickets. The whistling of bullets told
the rebels that they must fight or run and that the decision
must be made at once. In the light of subsequent
evidence it may be considered likely that Colonel Porterfield
was willing to fight, but the Confederate soldiers
deemed it best to run, and they did. They stood not
upon the order of their going but went at once and with
the utmost precipitation. It was a regular “skedaddle,”
to use a word that was current in war times.</p>

<p>The Cleveland artillerymen had an opportunity to use
their guns and they made the most of it, to the extent of
sixteen rounds. Although sharing fully in the wild excitement
of the first meeting with the enemy they served
their pieces with a coolness and skill that elicited from
those in command words of the highest praise. (It is
a matter of record that their missiles took off the leg of
one soldier, the first casualty by artillery fire in the field
done by the Union forces, but it is undeniably true that
the roar of their guns and the plunging shot greatly
aided in demoralizing the rebels and accelerating the
speed with which they sought a safe place far in the
rear.)</p>

<p>The rebels fled in wild dismay, utterly heedless of the
efforts of their officers to stem the tide of disaster. They
had barely time to get away, and left behind them a large
quantity of supplies and material of war which had
been collected. The rear end of the disorganized rebel
procession had not disappeared when Colonel Kelley’s
column came in sight. His advance dashed after the
enemy, himself at the head, and there was a brisk skirmish.
It did not last long, however, as the rebels fled
out of range at the earliest possible moment. None of
the Union soldiers were killed. A few were wounded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
and among them the gallant Colonel Kelley, who received
a pistol shot in the breast, which incapacitated him from
duty for some weeks. Prolonged pursuit of the fleeing
foe was impossible, owing to the extremely exhausted
condition of the men after their all-night march in the
storm, while the rebels were fresh and able to get off
at a speed that defied successful competition. The command
of the Union forces devolved upon Colonel Dumont.</p>

<p>The Confederate Colonel Porterfield and his staff had
been living in fine style at the village “tavern.” A good
breakfast had been prepared for them by “mine host,”
but the latter suddenly found himself entertaining unbidden
and wholly unexpected guests. The inordinate
haste with which the rebel commander and his official
family evacuated the town would not permit them to
partake of that breakfast, and it was eaten, with profoundly
thankful hearts—and stomachs—by a company
of Union officers.</p>

<p>The following is an extract from the official report of
the affair, made to General McClellan by General
Morris:</p>

<p>“The enemy was entirely off his guard and was completely
surprised, as the reports of those engaged in the
attack attest. The failure to capture the entire rebel
force can only be attributed to the storm during the
night. This unforeseen misfortune served to call forth
an endurance seldom exhibited, and I feel that the heroism
of officers and men was as truly displayed in a march
of fifteen miles in pitchy darkness, drenching rain, and
over a mountainous country as in the irresistible attack
and hot pursuit of the discomfited enemy. The last five
miles of Colonel Dumont’s column was made in one hour
and a quarter. Many men fainted and were left on the
road. Others threw away their haversacks and provisions
to keep up, rushing forward with a determination
that showed what spirit animated the command. I
regard it as remarkable that under such circumstances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
the two columns were but fifteen minutes apart at the
time assigned for their meeting. An able reconnoissance
in advance of Colonel Dumont’s column was made by
Colonel F. W. Lauder, whose voluntary aid I gladly accepted,
and to whose advice and assistance I am greatly
indebted. The immediate direction of the artillery was
confided to him. After the bridge was taken he pressed
forward and joined Colonel Kelley, rode into the enemy’s
ranks and captured the prisoner reported to have shot
Colonel Kelley. He had great difficulty in restraining
the Virginia volunteers from summarily dispatching
the man, who was a noted secessionist and a quartermaster
of the rebel forces.</p>

<p>“From the reports of Colonel Dumont (who, by reason
of the fall of Colonel Kelley, had command), you will
perceive there is much difficulty in making an accurate
statement of the enemy’s losses. The killed are estimated
at from fifteen to forty, which were carried off it
is supposed by friends, during the confusion incident to
the pursuit of the enemy. A large amount of camp
equipage, provisions, arms, wagons, horses and medical
stores were captured, an inventory of which will be made
as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>When the tidings reached Cleveland of the “battle”
and the creditable manner in which the “boys” had
acquitted themselves, they were regarded as the heroes
of the hour—warriors of the first magnitude. It was
Cleveland’s first record under fire and the citizens felt
a justifiable pride in the honorable part borne by their
representatives in almost the first engagement of the
war.</p>

<p>That the action at Philippi was not more sanguinary
was not the fault of the Union soldiers. If the rebels had
stayed no doubt there would have been a warm engagement.
It takes two parties to get up a fight, and when
one of them “runs away” in order that he may
“live to fight another day,” there is no alternative but
to postpone the battle until that day comes around. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
it was a clear and unquestionable victory, if it wasn’t
a very big one. It was memorable as being the first
field guns fired on the Union side in the Civil War.
It was hailed through the North with loud
acclaim. The newspapers teemed with praise of
the gallant men who won it, and the mails were burdened
with letters of congratulation and compliment
from friends at home. It showed that the raw volunteers
from the North had that endurance and pluck of
which soldiers are made; it did much to prick the bubble
of idle boasting that one Southern man could whip five
“Yankees.” Indeed, it rather looked as though it was
the Southern soldiers who would not fight, and some
people believed, after Philippi, that the war was about
over. Some of the victorious blue-coats thought so and
they felt an exceeding great joy that they had been
permitted to participate in the action that was the death-blow
to the rebellion.</p>

<p>The satisfaction that filled loyal hearts everywhere
was only equaled by the apprehension and alarm in the
South that were caused by even so trifling a defeat as
this. Especially was this true of the Confederate forces
in Western Virginia, which were for a time in an almost
hopeless state of demoralization. One point after
another was being seized and held by the Union troops;
regiments from Ohio and Indiana were hurrying forward
to reinforce them, and there seemed little hope of being
able to dislodge them from that part of the state. After
the disaster at Philippi frantic dispatches were sent to
the civil and military authorities at Richmond, representing
the Confederate cause in that section to be in a
desperate condition, and urging immediate and decisive
steps to reorganize and reinforce the army, unless Western
Virginia was to be abandoned to the enemy. It
will not be out of place here to give one or two extracts
from the correspondence which took place at this time
between rebel officials in Western Virginia and at Richmond.
Under date of June 6th, 1861, Major M. G. Harman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
commanding at Staunton, wrote to General Robert
E. Lee:</p>

<p>“From all the information that I have received I am
pained to have to express my conviction that Colonel Porterfield
is entirely unequal to the position which he occupies.
The affair at Philippi was a disgraceful surprise,
occurring about daylight, there being no picket or guard
of any kind on duty. The only wonder is that our men
were not cut to pieces. They were all asleep and were
only aroused by the firing of the enemy. The safety of the
Northwest and of our inexperienced soldiers depends
upon an immediate change of commanders, and giving
the command to a bold and experienced leader. * * *
* * I would again urge rapid reinforcements to regain
possession of the Northwest, and that I may receive from
you authority to call out and arm the companies from
all the valley counties and send them to that quarter
instead of their going, as heretofore directed, to their
different rendezvous. Send up five thousand flint-lock
muskets from Richmond and I will have them overhauled
and put in order for use.”</p>

<p>On the same day Major Harman sent a communication
to Colonel Porterfield in which he said:</p>

<p>“Tomorrow I shall send you a field battery, accompanied
by cavalry and infantry, which will be joined by
other troops on the way and the whole force will report
to you at Beverly. On the day following from two to
three thousand troops will be sent to you by President
Davis from Richmond. I have received a telegraphic
dispatch from the Commander-in-Chief of our army,
saying: “Send a messenger to tell Colonel Porterfield to
be valiant and maintain his ground until relief reaches
him. Send him supplies if he wants them.” Having received
no official communication from you, but learning
from private sources, since the disaster to our arms at
Philippi, that you are almost without ammunition, I
have determined to send you a supply by express.”</p>

<p>When Porterfield and his men left Philippi they did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
not stop running until they reached Huttonsville, nearly
forty miles southward, and near Beverly, in Randolph
county. From his headquarters there Porterfield wrote
on June 9th to Colonel R. S. Garnett, Adjutant General
of the Virginia forces at Richmond:</p>

<p>“My force is not only deficient in drill but ignorant,
both officers and men, of the most ordinary duties of the
soldier. With efficient drill officers they might be made
effective; but I have to complain that the field officers
sent to command these men are of no assistance to me,
and are, for the most part, as ignorant of their duties
as the company officers, and they as ignorant as the
men. I hope, if I am continued in command, that good
staff officers may be sent me to aid in organizing this
raw force, than which there is none more so now in the
service. * * * It is necessary that at least five
thousand well-drilled men should be sent at once, as the
enemy’s army is being daily reinforced; and if aid is not
soon sent it will be impossible to keep the open field,
even as a mere corps of observation, but we will have
to retire to the mountains, where it will be most difficult,
if not impossible, to provision even this small
force.”</p>

<p>On June 11th Porterfield again wrote to Colonel Garnett
and asked for a chance to redeem himself:</p>

<p>“The enemy remains at Philippi where they are reported
to have about five thousand men and are fortifying
themselves. The same number are said to be at
Grafton. From five hundred to one thousand are said
to be at Cheat River Bridge and other forces are stationed
at different points on the railroads. * * * A
regiment from Tennessee is expected here tomorrow,
having in charge, as I am informed, some pieces of
heavy artillery. No pieces heavier than 6-pounders
should be sent to this country until some position is
selected to be fortified and a strong and reliable infantry
force is sent to support it. * * * The percussion
caps sent have nearly all been of small size, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
shot-guns, and not large enough for muskets. As reinforcements
are now expected, and we shall have active
service in this part of the state, I desire to be continued
on duty here. It was not until after repeated
calls for aid, and when left with a small militia force
entirely unprepared for the field, that I asked for duty
elsewhere.”</p>

<p>But the Confederate authorities did not intend to have
any more Philippis if they could avoid it by a change of
commanders. On June 13th General Lee wrote from
Richmond to Porterfield, informing him that Garnett
had been promoted to Brigadier General and had been
sent to take command in Northwestern Virginia.</p>

<p>A court of inquiry was created to inquire into the
conduct of Porterfield at Philippi and the causes which
led to the inglorious defeat and rout of the Confederate
force. The court made an exhaustive investigation and
submitted, on May 4, 1861, a lengthy report thereupon.
A few extracts from this document will be read with
interest by those who had a hand in the game:</p>

<p>“* * * On the morning of the day just indicated, at
between daybreak and sunrise, this command was attacked
and taken by surprise; no alarm or intimation
of the enemy’s approach having been given by the
guard or infantry pickets until the enemy was within
some four hundred yards of the place, and had commenced
the fire from his artillery. It is shown that a
main and picket guard, as strong as was consistent with
the effective infantry force present, was regularly detailed
and posted at distances sufficiently far out to
accomplish the object in view, provided they knew and
did their duty, which latter is strongly to be suspected,
from the fact that, although in advance, they failed to
give any intimation of the enemy’s approach—a conclusion
which is strengthened by the report of the mounted
officers out with the scouting parties on the night of
June 2nd, that they had neither seen an infantry picket
nor been challenged by its sentinels, going from or returning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
to the town that night. It appears that immediately
upon the arrival of the command at Philippi
the officer in command, Colonel Porterfield, took measures
to place his force, which was raw and new in
service, under a course of instruction, and to select
those in his opinion best fitted to instruct the sentinels
and guards in their duties. The testimony shows that,
while there was a certain degree of confusion in some
quarters, a portion of the command moved from the
town in good order, and that the whole force, nearly,
after passing some distance, was reformed and proceeded
in order.</p>

<p>“It is shown in the evidence that an expectation of
attack or movement on Philippi, shortly to be made, was
generally entertained among the officers and others of
the command, and that intelligence (how well founded
is not known) was brought from time to time of the
strength and supposed intent of the enemy.</p>

<p>“The testimony sets forth that this had so far produced
its effect as to induce the officer in command to
call a meeting of his officers; that the result of their
consultations and deliberations was an almost if not entirely
unanimous decision in favor of immediate retreat;
that when Colonel Porterfield returned to the room
(from which he had been absent a short time), their
opinion was conveyed to him, to which he seemed loath
to accede; yet, determined to make a further examination
of the ammunition on hand, and to prepare the
baggage and train for removal at a moment’s notice.”</p>

<p>Here follow several points in which, according to the
judgment of this court, the commanding officer “erred.”
General R. E. Lee, in reviewing the case, approved the
finding of the court and said:</p>

<p>“The commanding general remarks with pleasure upon
the coolness, self-possession, courage and energy displayed
by Colonel Porterfield at the moment of attack;
but he cannot exonerate him from blame in not taking
proper precautionary measures beforehand. Yet, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
consideration of all the circumstances of the case, he
does not think it necessary to do more than to express
the opinion of the court, in the hope that the sad effects
produced by the want of forethought and vigilance,
exhibited in this case, will be a lesson to be remembered
by the army throughout the war.”</p>

<p>After the action at Philippi came a season of inaction.
The available Union force was not deemed sufficient to
make a further advance without too great risk of defeat,
which would put in imminent jeopardy all the advantage
that had been gained. For a month the troops lay quietly
at Philippi, detachments being stationed to guard the
bridges on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The headquarters
of the Cleveland Artillery were at Philippi, but
the companies were scattered, some of them, with their
guns, doing duty with the bridge guards. There were
constant rumors of active service ahead and of impending
attacks by the enemy, but none of them appeared to
have any foundation in fact, for the weeks passed without
any of “war’s alarms” of a serious nature.</p>

<p>During the latter part of June General Henry A. Wise
became a prominent factor in Confederate operations in
Western Virginia. At the head of a considerable force
he threatened an attack upon Philippi. As the Fourth of
July drew near a report came to be currently believed
that on that day he would attempt to retake the place.
All arrangements possible for defense were made.
Neither officers nor soldiers had yet learned much about
fortifying, in the art of which they became so skilled at
a later day, but some rude works had been thrown up
which promised to be serviceable and “handy” in case
of attack. Part of the guns of the Cleveland Artillery
were kept in position where it was thought they might
do the most good if there came a rebel visitation. A
strong and vigilant picket guard was maintained to prevent
anything in the nature of a surprise.</p>

<p>Most of the soldiers were in a sad plight as to clothing.
Especially was this true of the members of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
Cleveland Artillery. Much of the wretchedly poor,
shoddy clothing received by them at Camp Putnam had
literally fallen to pieces. The men were actually in rags.
Some of them went around during those warm July
days with only drawers to cover the nakedness of their
nether limbs. They looked more like a congregation of
beggars than patriotic American citizens engaged in the
work of saving the country. That pestilent insect, the
“grayback,” made its appearance and was soon on terms
of the closest intimacy with them. Probably not one
in twenty of these innocent young men had ever seen
one of these things before. Most of them did not even
know that this carnivorous bug had an existence in the
wide and variegated realm of animated nature. But it
did not take them long to become extensively acquainted
with him.</p>

<p>Patriotic emotions were active as the “Glorious
Fourth” drew near, and although the American Eagle
seemed to be in a bad way just then, it was determined
to have a fitting celebration of the day, whether or not
Wise kept his reputed engagement. Notwithstanding
their dilapidated condition the members of the artillery
entered into the matter with great gusto. The arrangements
were made by a committee consisting of Colonels
Dumont, Sixth Indiana, Milroy, Ninth Indiana, Lieutenant
Colonel Dickey, Fifteenth Ohio, “Bob” McCook,
Ninth Ohio, Barnett, Cleveland Light Artillery, and
others. During the month previous the Union forces
had been augmented by several additional regiments, as
designated above.</p>

<p>An elaborate program was made out, which included
speeches, music, both vocal and instrumental, and, of
course, the reading of that patriotic but somewhat musty
and dusty old document, the Declaration of Independence.
This always has been, and probably always will
be, considered an essential factor in a Fourth of July
celebration, under any and all circumstances, although
nobody ever listens to it, or can remember, five minutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
after a single word of what it contains. In casting
about for a person who could read this ponderous paper
with fitting dignity and impressiveness the committee
decided upon Warren P. Edgarton, then a private of
Company D, Cleveland Light Artillery, who had won
some reputation as an elocutionist, and he was promptly
detailed for this duty.</p>

<p>Edgarton was in sore distress of mind over the condition
of his wardrobe. He hadn’t any clothes to speak of,
and half the time was running around camp with only
a ragged shirt and a pair of drawers. He had a fine
physique and would tip the beam at about a hundred and
eighty. He had a sort of artillery jacket but it was
three sizes too small, and when he crowded himself into
it he looked and felt like a woman wearing a tightly
laced corset; so that he didn’t put it on except on state
occasions, when his usual <em>negligee</em> uniform would be
considered a gross and violent breach of army regulations.
He had a pair of shoes that were three sizes too
large for even his substantial and well-developed feet,
in which he would go sloshing around camp. At night
he used to “park” his shoes outside, as there wasn’t
room for them in the tent, without crowding everybody
out. He wore on his head a little cap which, never
within an inch of his size, had so shrunk and shriveled
under the demoralizing influence of sun and storm that
it only lay upon the top of his head, looking not much
bigger than a postage stamp. All in all he was a startling
and picturesque object to stand before a crowd of
raging patriots and read the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>Something had to be done to get him into presentable
shape for the occasion. The honor and credit of the
Artillery were at stake. It would be an insult to the
“Spirit of Seventy-six” for such a half-naked tatterdemalion
to get up and pronounce the thundering sentences
of Thomas Jefferson. So Colonel Barnett, Captain
Rice and others whose pride was stirred began to forage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
through the town for some clothes that would adorn
Edgarton’s shapely form and redound to the credit of
the Battery. A black claw-hammer dress coat was
found after a long search and the owner consented to
loan it for the occasion. This was supplemented by
broadcloth trousers, a hat belonging to one of the officers
and a pair of fancy, high-heeled boots. The latter
one of the boys had brought along from home, with a
vague idea that they would be useful to him in putting
down the rebellion. They were not large enough for
Edgarton’s feet, but he contrived to squeeze into them
at the last moment and to endure their pinching while
he was doing his part in “letting the eagle scream.”</p>

<p>There had been considerable difficulty in finding a copy
of the Declaration. The Philippians of Western Virginia
were not a literary folk, and few of them appeared
ever to have heard of it. At length a copy was found,
in a musty law book at the courthouse.</p>

<p>Edgarton was greeted with hearty applause as he
mounted the platform. This was followed by general
laughter at his unique appearance. Such another “makeup”
was never seen in the army, before nor since, in this
or any other country. But he read the Declaration of
Independence in fine style and was tremendously
cheered. Lieutenant Colonel Geo. B. Este, of the Fourteenth
Ohio, followed with an admirable address; the
bands almost blew their heads off; patriotic songs were
sung; and the celebration was a great success. The
rebel General Wise failed to show up and nothing interfered
with the carrying out of the program.</p>

<p>No sooner had the “Glorious Fourth” been fittingly
and satisfactorily celebrated than the troops were directed
to prepare at once for another campaign. On
July 6th General Morris, commanding at Philippi, received
orders to advance early the following day, occupy
Belington, fifteen miles southward, and menace the
enemy, who was in strong position at Laurel Hill, near
that place. The movement was made promptly, according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
to the plan. The writer has before him a yellow,
ink-stained paper, a memento of the advance from
Philippi. It is endorsed “Programme, march to Laurel
Hill,” and announces the following order of the procession,
the words in brackets being supplied for explanatory
purposes:</p>

<p class="center">
First Virginia, four companies.<br>
Milroy [Ninth Indiana].<br>
Steadman, First Battalion [Fourteenth Ohio].<br>
Barnett, four pieces [Cleveland Light Artillery].<br>
Steadman, Second Battalion [Fourteenth Ohio].<br>
Barnett, two pieces [Cleveland Light Artillery]<br>
First Virginia, two companies.<br>
Dumont [Seventh Indiana].<br>
Headquarters<br>
Fulton<br>
Dickey [Fifteenth Ohio].<br>
Crittenden [Sixth Indiana].<br>
Ammunition wagons.<br>
Band.<br>
Four caissons, two guns [Cleveland Light Artillery].<br>
</p>

<p>It will be observed that both front and rear were well
protected by artillery. The commanding general prudently
sandwiched his headquarters in the center of the
column. We must also admire the tender solicitude
for the safety of the band, as shown by its position as
far as possible from the front and flanked by two guns
and four caissons of Barnett’s artillery.</p>

<p>The march was begun about midnight. The movement
was rapid and at daylight the skirmishers struck the
rebel pickets near Belington. A section of the artillery
was immediately ordered to the front and a few shells
were tossed among the enemy’s outposts, with most demoralizing
effect. The Union skirmishes, well supported,
quickly pushed the pickets back to the main line,
which was strongly fortified. Some of the pickets
showed fight at first and there was a brisk skirmish, in
which the Cleveland Artillery suffered its first casualty.
George W. Tillotson, of Company D, caught a musket
ball in the groin. He received every possible attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
and as soon as circumstances would permit was sent to
the rear. He finally reached his home in Cleveland but
never fully recovered, dying from the effects of his
wound, a few years later. He was the first man from
Cleveland to shed his blood in the Union cause.</p>

<p>When the artillery was ordered to move there was the
greatest activity in preparing for the impending campaign.
The men were exceedingly anxious to acquit
themselves with credit, and spared no pains to make the
battery as effective as possible. The ammunition was
carefully inspected and put in order, and the guns were
polished until they shone like mirrors. The men were
“hard up” for clothing, the supply having been exceedingly
limited—scanty in quantity and poor in quality.
Every effort had been made to procure better supplies
but without success. The state authorities and the
United States government appeared to be about equally
neglectful of the needs of the soldiers. Rations were
generally good and sufficient, and there was little cause
for complaint on that score.</p>

<p>Whenever occasion offered the artillery served with
excellent effect. The years of instruction and drill at
home proved a most valuable school. The skill of the
gunners in training their pieces and timing shells was
such as to win for them the warmest commendations.
The members of the infantry regiment formed a strong
attachment for the artillerymen. They had an abiding
faith in the efficacy of Barnett’s cannon, and when engaged
in any movement seemed to be doubly confident
if accompanied by a section or two of the artillery.</p>

<p>The order from General McClellan to General Morris
was to avoid delivering battle at Laurel Hill if possible,
but to firmly press the enemy at all points and hold him
in his works, until the co-operating column under General
Rosecrans should come up and attack in flank and
rear. Rosecrans struck the rebels at Rich Mountain
and after a hot fight completely routed them, capturing
many prisoners and a large quantity of material of war.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
The confederate defeat at Rich Mountain and the prompt
advance of General Rosecrans rendered the rebel position
at Laurel Hill untenable. The enemy abandoned
it in great haste.</p>

<p>During the few days that the troops under General
Morris lay at Belington there was constant skirmishing
with the enemy. Day and night all were kept on the
alert, and the whistle of bullets began to be a familiar
sound. The guns of the Cleveland Artillery were advantageously
posted and were brought into occasional
use. The men were constantly at their posts. Now and
then a shell or a solid shot would be sent over to the
rebels, just to let them know that the “Yankees” were
still there and wide awake. In an official report dated
“Headquarters near Belington, Va., July 9, 1861,” General
Morris says:</p>

<p>“The instructions of the commanding general will be
carried out, although it is difficult to restrain our men
from advancing. I hardly know in what terms to convey
to you their enthusiasm. Their coolness under such
fire as we have been subjected to (incessant since our
arrival), is most creditable to them, and establishes beyond
all question, if proof were needed, that they can
be relied upon in any emergency. The regiments in advance
are Milroy’s Ninth Indiana, Barnett’s Artillery,
Steadman’s Fourteenth Ohio, and Dumont’s Seventh Indiana,
all of which deserve special mention.”</p>

<p>On July 12th the rebels, having retreated from Belington
and Laurel Hill during the day and night previous,
General Morris moved in pursuit. The following
is an extract from a report made by him dated “Carrick’s
Ford, Va., July 14, 1861:</p>

<p>“I reported yesterday morning the progress of the
forces of my command in pursuit of the enemy retreating
from Laurel Hill. The pursuit was continued
through the day in the same order as stated in my report
of yesterday morning, viz.: Steadman’s Fourteenth
Ohio in advance with two sections of Barnett’s artillery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
next Dumont’s Seventh Indiana and Milroy’s Ninth Indiana.
These regiments started in pursuit from our
resting place near Leadsville at about 4 o’clock in
the morning. The remainder of the troops were on the
march by 5 o’clock a. m. A drizzling rain commenced
about 6 o’clock, which by 9 became quite heavy.
The enemy left the main turnpike and turned towards
Cheat river, crossing two branches of the Laurel mountain
over a narrow and rough road. Owing to the heavy
rain the roads were rendered very difficult for the men
and the few wagons of ammunition and provisions. By
11 o’clock the rain became a drenching storm and
so continued for several hours, the roads in the mountains
becoming almost impassable. At 2 o’clock the
whole command was up in the position we now occupy.</p>

<p>“The attention of the commanding general is particularly
called to the gallant bearing of the infantry and
artillery which led the advance. I would also call attention
to the fact that the entire command commenced the
pursuit on a few minutes’ notice, without time to prepare
even a day’s rations for the haversacks. I ordered
four wagons to be loaded with hard bread and pork to
follow the command. These four wagons, with the little
additional rations put in with the ammunition, are all
the provisions the command has had since leaving Belington,
except some beeves procured in this vicinity.</p>

<p>“The march of yesterday was from eighteen to twenty
miles. When it is considered that we have put to flight
a force equal to our own, and have pursued the rebels
night and day for thirty hours, almost without provisions,
over a mountainous and difficult road, and part
of the time through a drenching storm, we may feel
sure that our cause must be successfully maintained by
men who show such gallant bearing and soldierly endurance.”</p>

<p>Then came the brilliant attack upon the enemy at
Carrick’s Ford, which resulted in the utter defeat and
rout of the rebels. Their commander, General Garnett,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
was among the killed. The story of this important engagement
cannot be more concisely told than by giving
almost entire the official report of General H. W. Benham,
who was in immediate command of the Union
force. The report was made to General Morris:</p>

<p>“In accordance with your directions, I this morning
took command of the advance guard of your column, consisting
of the Fourteenth Ohio, Colonel Steadman, with
one section of Barnett’s Artillery, the Seventh Indiana,
Colonel Dumont, and the Ninth Indiana, Colonel Milroy,
in all about 1,800 men. With this force, as instructed,
I started from Leadsville at about 4 o’clock a. m. to
pursue the army of General Garnett, which, consisting,
as we learned, of 4,000 to 5,000 men and four to six
cannon, had retreated from the north side of Laurel
mountain near Belington the day before yesterday.
It being ascertained that the enemy had retired toward
the village of New Interest and thence, as was supposed,
over a mountain road leading to the Shafer Fork, or
main branch, of the Cheat river, to Saint George. The
troops were brought rapidly forward on their route, so
as to reach the entrance of the mountain road—about
seven miles march—at 6 o’clock. A short distance after
entering this path the passage was found to be obstructed
by large trees, recently felled, in about twelve
to fifteen places, and in nearly every defile for three or
four miles. Information was from time to time received
that this force, which had some fifteen hours the start
of us from Belington, was now only four to five miles
in advance. This encouraged our efforts, and though
for nearly the whole time the rain was pouring in torrents
and the clayey roads were in many places almost
impassable, the spirit of the troops, without exception,
as it came under my eye, was such as to bear them most
rapidly onward under all these trials, super-added to that
of hunger, with which the greater part of them had
suffered for the previous fifteen or twenty hours.</p>

<p>At about noon we reached Kaler’s, the first ford of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
Shafer Branch or main fork of Cheat river, having
within the previous two or three miles fired at and
driven in several pickets of the enemy protecting those
who were forming the barricades, and at one place we
broke up a camp where the meals were being cooked.
At the ford near Kaler’s, and at about half the distance
to another ford, which we afterward met with one mile
farther on, we saw the baggage train of the enemy,
apparently at rest. This I proposed to attack as soon as
strengthened by the arrival of Steadman’s second battalion,
with Dumont’s regiment, when the thoughtless
firing of a musket at our ford set the train rapidly in
motion, and long lines of infantry were formed in order
of battle to protect it. In a few minutes, however, the
arrival of Barnett’s artillery, with Dumont close upon it,
enabled the command to push forward in its original
order, but the train and its guard had retired, leaving
only a few skirmishers to meet us at the second ford,
where, however, quite a rapid firing was kept up by
the advance regiment, and Barnett’s artillery opened for
some minutes to more completely clear the adjacent
woods of the enemy.</p>

<p>“We then continued our march rapidly to the ford, and
as we approached it we came upon the enemy’s train,
the last half of it just crossing, in the river. The enemy
was found to have taken a strong position, with his
infantry and artillery, upon a precipitous bank fifty to
eighty feet in height, upon the opposite side of the river,
while our own position was upon the low land, nearly
level with the river. Steadman’s regiment, in the advance,
opened fire most gallantly upon them, which was
immediately returned by their strong force of infantry
and by their cannon, upon which Barnett’s artillery was
ordered up and opened upon them with excellent effect.</p>

<p>As I soon perceived a position by which their left
could be turned, six companies of Colonel Dumont’s
regiment were ordered to cross the river about three
hundred yards above them, to pass up the hill obliquely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
from our right to their left, and take them in rear.
Owing to some mistake, possibly in the transmission of
the order, this command crossed about double the
distance intended and turned at first to their right,
which delayed the effect of the movement. After some
fifteen minutes, however, this error was rectified, and,
the hill being reported as impracticable, this command,
now increased to the entire regiment, was ordered down
to the ford, there to take the enemy directly in front at
the road.</p>

<p>“The firing of Steadman’s regiment and of Milroy’s,
now well up and in action, with repeated and rapid discharges
from Barnett’s artillery during this movement,
decided the action at once. As Dumont reached the
road, having passed along and under their whole front,
the firing ceased and the enemy fled in great confusion.
Dumont’s regiment pursued them for about one mile
farther, having brisk skirmishing with their rear for
the first half of that distance, during which General
Garnett was killed. The enemy would still have been
followed up most closely, and probably to the capture
of a large portion of their scattered army, but this was
absolutely impossible with our fatigued and exhausted
troops, who had already marched eighteen miles or more,
in an almost incessant, violent rain, the greater part of
them without food since the evening and a portion of
them even from the noon of yesterday, so warm had
been the pursuit of the enemy on their hasty retreat
from Laurel Mountain, twenty-six miles distant. The
troops were, therefore, halted for food and rest at about
2 p. m.</p>

<p>“The result of the action proves to be the capture of
about forty loaded wagons and teams, being nearly all
the enemy’s baggage train, as we learn, and including
a large portion of new clothing, camp equipage and
other stores; their headquarter papers and military
chest; also two stands of colors and one fine rifled piece
of artillery; while the commanding general, Robert S.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
Garnett, is killed, his body being now cared for by us,
and fifteen or twenty more of the enemy are killed and
nearly fifty prisoners taken. Our own loss is two killed
and six or seven wounded—one dangerously.</p>

<p>“In concluding this report I feel it my duty to state
that just as the action was closing, the head regiment
of the body of troops under yourself, though starting as
I learn three hours later, the Sixth Indiana, under
Colonel Crittenden, came upon the field in excellent
order, but, unfortunately, too late to aid us in the
battle.</p>

<p>“The conduct of those gallant officers, Colonels Barnett,
Steadman, Dumont and Milroy, with the steady perseverance
of their officers and men in their long and arduous
march, suffering from hunger, rain and cold, with
their gallantry in action, was most heroic and beyond all
praise of mine. Their country only can fully appreciate
and reward their services.”</p>

<p>This was the most important victory that had yet been
achieved by the Union forces anywhere. It is true that
very small figures expressed the losses on either side,
but loyal people everywhere were anxiously watching
for successes, and the “battle” of Carrick’s Ford threw
the whole North into a spasm of tempestuous rejoicing.
The pluck and heroism of the volunteers was lauded to
the skies—and it may fairly be said that they deserved
it. The members of the Ohio artillery, with whom this
chronicle has particularly to do, had added fresh laurels
to those gained at Philippi and Laurel Hill, and the
people of Cleveland regarded them in the same light in
which the world looks upon the Six Hundred who made
the historic charge at Balaklava. So conspicuous were
their services and so gallant their bearing that they
were awarded the cannon captured from the enemy at
Carrick’s Ford. At the close of the three months’
service they took this trophy back with them to Cleveland.
It was placed in the Public Square, where it remaineth
unto this day, with an inscription upon it that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
he who runs may read. This inscription, by the way,
was at first fearfully and wonderfully made. A
geographical student would be impressed with the fact
that unless the people of Cleveland could fight better
than they could spell they wouldn’t capture many cannon
in that or any other war. The inscription, which
was put on by somebody who was not within three
hundred miles of the battle, informed the wayfarer that
the gun was captured at “Corricke’s Forde.” The atrocious
orthography greeted the public eye for nearly
twenty years, when it was corrected, to the great satisfaction
of the old survivors of the artillery.</p>

<p>The writer has before him the official reports of a
number of Confederate officers who participated in the
action at Carrick’s Ford. Naturally they magnify the
Union force and losses, and in a measure that is ridiculous.
They place the Union strength at from ten to
fifteen thousand, their own being but a tenth of
that number. The “Yankees” are estimated to have had
on their hands after this action material for one
hundred and fifty funerals, with one additional loss of
from two to four hundred wounded. It will be remembered
that General Benham, in his official report to
General Morris, states that the Union loss was “two
killed and six or seven wounded.”</p>

<p>It is interesting to note the extreme caution shown
at that time by officers and others on the Union side in
communicating with the rebels. There was an evident
desire to avoid the slightest word that would appear to
be a recognition of any official authority, civil or
military, among the insurgents. It was considered that
if a rebel general or colonel was addressed as such it
was a virtual recognition of the power that conferred
such rank upon him. So, on July 15, General McClellan
addressed a communication “To the Officer Commanding
the Forces Commanded by the late Robert S. Garnett,
Esq., styling himself Brigadier-General Confederate
States Army.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>The battle of Carrick’s Ford ended the fighting of the
Cleveland Artillery in the three months’ service. The
command moved back to Belington and the artillery
was ordered to report to General McClellan, who had
planned an expedition up the Kanawha Valley after the
rebel General Wise. He warmly complimented Colonel
Barnett and his men for their valuable services in the
campaign under General Morris, and expressed an
earnest wish that they might accompany him up the
Kanawha. As a matter of fact they had not as yet even
been mustered into the United States service, and the
three months for which they were called out had expired.
But, pursuant to orders, Colonel Barnett reported
with his command to McClellan at Beverly, where the
General made a personal appeal to the men to accompany
his expedition, and nearly all of them expressed a willingness
to do so. A few days later, before McClellan was
ready for the Kanawha campaign, came the first real
battle of the war—that of Bull Run, in Virginia, which
resulted in the rout of the Union army under McDowell
and brought to the people of the North an actual
realization of the fact that they had a war on their
hands. In the wild excitement that followed this battle
General McClellan was summoned to Washington to take
command of the Army of the Potomac and his plans for
further offensive operations in Western Virginia were
for the time abandoned.</p>

<p>A week later Colonel Barnett and his “regiment” of
artillery were ordered to be discharged and started at
once for Columbus. It should be stated here, to their
credit, that the citizens of Cleveland had done all in
their power to contribute to the comfort and wellbeing
of the command during its service in the field. It has
already been said that the men were but poorly supplied
with clothing by the state and national governments,
for which apparent neglect there was much good reason.
The three months’ men were called out suddenly and
pushed to the front to meet a great and pressing emergency.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
Their services and sacrifices were of inestimable
value to the country. They secured a permanent lodgment
at many points beyond the border, and held the
enemy at bay while the government was getting ready
for the mighty struggle which followed. The echoes of
Sumter found the nation totally unprepared for such a
crisis, and it is not a matter of wonder that the early
volunteers who, with magnificent patriotism, responded
so promptly to the call, were but indifferently provided
for. The people of Cleveland contributed liberally, and
twice Mr. David Price came to the camp of the artillerymen
with quantities of clothing, food and delicacies for
the sick. But for this most highly appreciated kindness
the boys in the field would have had scarcely so much
as fig-leaves to cover their nakedness. It is true there
wasn’t much “uniform” about the garments and they
were a grotesque appearing lot of men for soldiers, but
it gave them a comparative degree of comfort and they
“got there just the same” as if they had been arrayed in
all the gorgeous trappings of martial splendor. All the
greater honor was theirs because they served so faithfully
and well and bore without complaint the discomforts
and privations inseparable from a campaign in such
a country and under such circumstances.</p>

<p>In due time, with little delay <em>en route</em>, the artillery
reached Columbus, homeward bound. The tanned and
ragged volunteers, fresh from fields of glory, were welcomed
with great enthusiasm at the state capital. They
had done well their part and their fame had gone before
them, losing nothing in its travels. They were looked
upon as the saviors of their country and people of every
grade and rank were proud to do them honor.</p>

<p>It may well be imagined that the boys were in a hurry
to get home, and the formalities necessary to their release
were hurried as fast as possible. The officers and
men were paraded for muster and were mustered in and
out of the United States service at the same time. Then
all were paid off in gold. The amount received did not,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
it is true, raise them at once to a condition of opulence.
Less than fifty dollars apiece didn’t look very large for
more than three months of such toil, hardship and
danger, but for the time, with the gold chinking in his
pocket, each man felt as if he owned a bank. Their
financial condition was in marked contrast to the state
of chronic insolvency in which they had been so long,
for they had had no funds with which to patronize the
sutler except such as was sent them at irregular intervals
by friends at home. Whenever one of them got ten
dollars he was looked upon as a Rothschild or a Vanderbilt
and loans were negotiated with a rapidity that soon
exhausted his wealth. As a general thing when a man
got any money it was quickly absorbed by the liquidation
of his debts. After the interview with the paymaster
at Columbus there was a universal squaring of
accounts.</p>

<p>The horses and other property belonging to the state
were turned over to the authorities, and the “regiment”
was soon ready to start for Cleveland. The men had
been permitted to bring with them from Western Virginia
(as a recognition of their valor and conspicuous
services), the piece of artillery captured at Carrick’s
Ford, and four long-eared mules which the rebels had
used as the propelling power of the cannon in their
migratory wanderings. These trophies were guarded
with zealous care, for the boys were proud of them, as
they had a right to be. At Columbus they were objects
of the greatest curiosity and interest. War, right at
home, was then a new thing to the people of the country
and anything of this nature was regarded as a nine-days’
wonder.</p>

<p>While at Columbus a telegram was received by Colonel
Barnett from Amasa Stone, Esq., of Cleveland, inquiring
at what time the artillery would arrive in Cleveland.
The friends of the warriors as well as the citizens generally
desired to know in order that they might give them
a fitting reception. The dispatch was duly answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
as soon as the time of departure could be definitely
fixed. At length all things were ready, and after midnight
of July 28th the happy artillerymen, with their
trophies of cannon and mules, left for Cleveland. How
the boys shouted and yelled as the train “pulled out”
of the depot and sped away toward “home, sweet home!”
In fact they didn’t do much but yell all the way to Cleveland.
Their coming had been heralded along the route
and at every station crowds of people greeted them
in the most tumultuous manner. If the boys could have
charged dime museum price for looking at the gun and
mules from rebeldom they would have made their fortunes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile elaborate preparations were going on in
Cleveland to welcome the returning volunteers with
open arms. They were expected to arrive during the
forenoon and before 9 o’clock a great multitude of
people thronged the railroad and its approaches. It was
something like the crowd that, more than three months
before, had assembled to bid them farewell and God
speed. Shortly before the arrival of the train the city
militia and the fire department marched down Champlain
street and formed in line near the railroad.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock the train came in sight and as it drew
up to the point of debarkation at the foot of Vineyard—now
known as South Water—street a mighty volume of
cheers went up from the assembled multitude—cheers
for Colonel Barnett, cheers for the brave soldiers, and
cheers for the cannon and mules that the boys had
captured from the “seceshers.” As the men stepped from
the cars they were clasped in the arms of loved ones,
who wept tears of joy at the safe return of sons and
brothers and husbands. Then came the hearty and
effusive greetings of friends and acquaintances, amidst
constant cheering and the music of brass bands. It was
a glorious reception, creditable alike to the people of
Cleveland and to those who so well merited the demonstration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>After the hand-shaking and words of welcome were
over the returned soldiers formed in procession, a conspicuous
object in the column being the rebel 6-pounder,
to which were attached the mules lately in the Confederate
service. Two of the soldiers served in the
capacity of muleteers, each bestriding the “nigh” animal
of one of the teams. The novel outfit was prodigiously
cheered along the entire line of march.</p>

<p>Escorted by the city organizations, the fire department
and an immense throng of people, the “veterans”
marched up Superior street to the Public Square, General
A. S. Sanford acting as marshal. The whole street
was thronged with men, women and children, with smiles
of greeting upon their faces and shouts upon their lips.
The windows and balconies were filled with ladies, who
waved their handkerchiefs in kindly welcome and
clapped their hands as the “brown soldiers come back
from the borders” went tramping by. Company D,
Captain P. W. Rice, carried a rebel flag captured at
Philippi which was loudly cheered—not because it was
an emblem of treason but because it was captured by
Cleveland volunteers.</p>

<p>Arrived at the Park the artillerymen were formed in a
hollow square, surrounded by thousands of people, and
were addressed as follows by Judge Samuel Starkweather,
who had been chosen to extend a formal welcome
home:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">
To the Light Artillery and Colonel Barnett, their gallant
and noble commander.</p>

<p>I am commissioned by the citizens of this city to bid
you a cordial welcome upon your return, and to tell
you that Cleveland fully appreciates the value of your
services and feels herself honored by your achievements.
She feels that some portion of the glory which
has fallen upon the noble men of the Cleveland Artillery
rests also upon herself.</p>

<p>Whenever you have appeared the rebels have fled and
have not dared to show their faces. The Cleveland and
Geneva artillery were among the first to answer the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
call of the government to put down rebellion; and when
it was sought to destroy the banner of our country,
you, gentlemen of the artillery, rushed forth to the field
to fight for its rescue, and you did not return from
that field until you saw that beautiful banner floating
from every Virginia hilltop.</p>

<p>We have not been ignorant of the trials through
which you have passed, and we have admired the firmness
with which you overcame all obstacles that presented
themselves to you and incumbered your path,
whether rugged mountains or rushing rivers, or hunger
or fatigue.</p>

<p>We have heard of you at Philippi—and the rebels
heard of you, too, and with even more lasting impressions.
We have heard of you also at Laurel Hill and
Carrick’s Ford. I am happy, too, that we have not
heard of any violation of the rights of justice or of
humanity on your part toward a conquered foe. This
has shown that you are actuated by the same motives
which have prompted our whole people. It is not the
object of this contest to interfere with the institutions
of any state, but it is our purpose to defend and preserve
the banner, that not a star may be blotted out or a
stripe defaced. It is to enforce laws to which we all
owe our safety, our protection and our happiness, and
I know I speak your sentiments when I say that whoever
takes a part in this contest from other motives is
unworthy the name of a patriot.</p>

<p>There is now being enacted a drama which is attracting
the eyes of the whole civilized world, and I am
proud to say that the members of this company have
well played their part therein; and when the last scene
is ended no name will more adorn the history of these
events than that of the Cleveland Artillery; no achievements
will rank higher than those in which its members,
our own gallant soldiers, bore so conspicuous a
part.</p>
</div>

<p>Under the circumstances Judge Starkweather may be
pardoned for drawing a long bow, but candor compels
the admission that when the boys came home the “beautiful
banner” was not, strictly speaking, “floating from
every Virginia hill-top.” There were still a few hill-tops
left over which the star spangled flag was not
floating, nor did it float till some years later.</p>

<p>At the close of the loud and prolonged applause which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
greeted the Judge’s address, showing how clearly the
feelings of the people were in harmony with the sentiments
he expressed. Colonel Barnett made the following
brief reply:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Allow me, sir, on behalf of my command, as well as
for myself, to thank you, and through you the citizens
of Cleveland, for this greeting, which was wholly unexpected
by us. I have no words to express the gratitude
of our hearts toward our fellow citizens. We have the
satisfaction of knowing that we have borne our banner
in the van, and that we have endeavored to do our duty;
and so we return to you with a consciousness that we
are not entirely unworthy the confidence which we know
you have placed in us.</p>
</div>

<p>There was loud cheering and plenty of it as Colonel
Barnett bowed and retired, and the band struck up
“The Bowld Soger Boy.” The exercises over, the companies
were variously taken care of and the crowd
slowly dispersed. A committee of German citizens took
charge of Company E, Captain Heckman, and Company
B, Captain Mack, and escorted them to Haltnorth’s,
where they were filled up with refreshments, solid and
liquid. The four other companies were escorted to the
Weddell House, where a sumptuous dinner was served
them in fine style. It made up in some degree for the
many times during the previous three months when they
had yearned unspeakably for a “square meal.”</p>

<p>Later in the day the members of Company C, Captain
Pelton, were banqueted at their armory in Brooklyn
Village, a committee of fifteen ladies doing the honors
of the occasion. In the afternoon Company F, Captain
Kenny, took a train to Geneva, where its members were
right royally welcomed.</p>

<p>The following paragraphs from Cleveland newspapers
of the time will be of interest in this connection:</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">[<em>Leader</em>, July 30, 1861.]</p>

<p>The returned soldiers all look well and in excellent
condition physically, although they are as brown as
berries from exposure.</p>

<p>Among the artillerymen who yesterday returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
from the campaign in Western Virginia were three
members of Alert Hose Company—William Kidd, foreman;
Albert Smith, assistant foreman, and Private
E. S. Ransom. Of course, the social and
genial Alerts could not let them return without a
welcome, so last night a merry party of Alerts and a
few invited guests assembled in the elegant hall of the
hose-house to celebrate the event over a splendid supper.
Toasts, speeches and songs followed. Finally, the
hose-carriage was illuminated and the company escorted
the returned members to their homes, the blaze of innumerable
roman candles lighting their way up Superior
street.</p>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">[<cite>Plain Dealer</cite>, July 30, 1861.]</p>

<p>The returned artillerymen are the heroes of the day.
If you find a knot of men collected on a corner, the
bronzed countenance of a member of the artillery is
in the center and he is relating to the gaping crowd
his exploits and adventures among the rebels in Western
Virginia. It will be some time before their stock of
incidents is exhausted; and years hence the story may
be rehearsed to wondering grandchildren. They have
come home after nobly discharging their duty and meet
with the warm admiration and approval which they
have so richly merited. All honor to the brave artillerymen.</p>
</div>

<p>At a meeting of the Cleveland City Council, held on
the evening of July 30th, the following preamble and
resolutions, offered by Councilman T. N. Bond, were
adopted with great enthusiasm:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Whereas</em>, At the request of the Governor of Ohio the
Cleveland Artillery, embracing four companies from the
city, one from Brooklyn and one from Geneva, under
the command of Colonel James Barnett, left their homes
and business on the 22d day of April, 1861, on a day’s
notice, to perform such duty in the defense of the
Government as might be required of them, and</p>

<p><em>Whereas</em>, After gaining the confidence and approbation
of the people on our southeastern border, by their
fine conduct both as soldiers and citizens, they rendered
most important services to the country in the campaigns
in Western Virginia, distinguishing themselves for
activity, discipline and bravery in their laborious night
marches, and in the battles at Philippi, Belington and
Carrick’s Ford, and have now returned after more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
three months’ absence, with trophies of their victories
and the well-deserved approbation of their fellow citizens;
therefore be it</p>

<p><em>Resolved</em>, That in addition to the public and spontaneous
welcome already given them at their reception
yesterday, the mayor and city council of the city, and in
behalf of the city, hereby officially record their high appreciation
of the honor the Cleveland Artillery and its
noble commander have reflected upon the city whose
name they bear; that their self-denial, good conduct and
energy and their skill and bravery in the field have
won for them unfading honor; and that especially to
Colonel Barnett, for his coolness and judgment, his
manly and soldierly bearing under all vicissitudes, our
thanks are richly due and are hereby tendered.</p>

<p><em>Resolved</em>, That copies of the foregoing preamble and
resolutions be duly engrossed by the clerk and presented
to Colonel Barnett and to the several companies
under his command.</p>
</div>

<p>These resolutions were transmitted to Colonel Barnett
by Mayor Flint—long an active and zealous member of
the Cleveland Artillery—with the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">Mayor’s Office, City of Cleveland,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
August 4, 1861.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Colonel James Barnett.</p>

<p>Dear Sir: With this I take great pleasure, as the
executive officer of the city of Cleveland, in presenting
to you, and through you to the different companies
under your command, the resolutions of the City Council
of the city, expressive of their sense of the valuable
services rendered the country in your recent campaign
in Virginia.</p>

<p>As a member of the earliest organization of artillery
in this city, and from which simple detailed “squad”
of the Cleveland Grays has grown your complete and
valuable command, I take increased pleasure in presenting
to you these resolutions, expressing, as they do, my
own feelings regarding your action for the past three
months.</p>

<p class="center">Respectfully yours,</p>
<p class="right">E. S. FLINT, Mayor.</p>
</div>

<p>The following appeared editorially in the Cleveland
<cite>Leader</cite> of July 30th, 1862:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When the proclamation of the President called for
seventy-five thousand troops Ohio sprang to the work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
of furnishing her quota. The Cleveland Artillery was
the only organized body of the kind in the state, the
artillery in other places being only single sections
or squads. Colonel Barnett had been the life of the
four sections which were organized in this city. He immediately
took steps to go into service with his command,
and as soon as the necessary arrangements could
be made he reported himself ready for orders. He was
sent to the southern border of Ohio to protect it from
threatened invasion, and to be in readiness to move into
Virginia upon short notice. Since that time, without
ever having been mustered into either State or United
States service, he has led his brave boys through the
campaign in Western Virginia, where they have performed
prodigies of marching and have fought a good
fight when the enemy has given them the chance.
Colonel Barnett left his business here to go to war and
has labored unceasingly for the good of his men and the
discomfiture of the rebels. His services were fully appreciated
by General McClellan, who tendered him a
very complimentary invitation to accompany him to the
Kanawha Valley. Colonel Barnett intends, we understand,
to raise a full artillery regiment and go in for
the war. We wish him all success and trust his services
will be appreciated and recognized at headquarters.”</p>
</div>

<p>Thus these citizen soldiers, who at home often were
scoffed at for playing soldier in time of peace, by their
timely military training, were ready to, and did almost
at a day’s notice respond to the call of their country
and served it well. The artillery piece captured at Carrick’s
Ford was brought to Columbus and turned over
to the state, but Colonel Barnett wished to take it to
Cleveland. Said Quartermaster General Wood, who then
had charge of the arms of the state, to Colonel Barnett:
“I think no objection will be raised if you take the gun
to Cleveland; your men captured it and I guess you
can find a way to hold it.” The piece may now be seen
on the Public Square, in its way a monument to the
valor and heroism of the old artillerymen of Cleveland.</p>

<p>With this elaborate and protracted welcome home,
which would appear to have been most satisfactory to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
all concerned, in both its fullness and its cordiality,
closes the honorable record of the Cleveland Artillery in
the “three months’ service.” Henceforward we follow
the fortunes of the First Regiment Ohio Light Artillery,
through its four years of brilliant service in the field.</p>


<p class="center">INDEPENDENT COMPANIES.</p>

<p>But the seed sown by the old gun squad and the First
Cleveland Light Artillery had not yet exhausted its
strength. It continued to take root, expand and blossom.
Privates Joseph C. Shields and Frank Wilson, of Captain
Rice’s battery, after their three months’ service in the
First Regiment, Ohio Volunteer Artillery, imbued as
they had become with a military spirit, and with patriotic
impulse, soon organized an independent artillery
battery, which was mustered into service Sept. 10, 1862.
It numbered 164 men, had six guns, and was called the
Nineteenth Independent Battery, Ohio Volunteer Light
Artillery. Captain Shields became commander, who at
the end of two years resigned, when Mr. Wilson, who
had been first lieutenant of the company, became its
captain. The battery was in the siege of Knoxville, in
the East Tennessee campaign, in the siege of Atlanta,
Ga., and at other places of interest, historic in the great
struggle. The men were mustered out June 27, 1865,
at the close of the war.</p>

<p>In this battery was Quartermaster Sergeant Pardon
B. Smith, who afterwards became sheriff of Cuyahoga
County, and now each year meets with the “old association,”
gladdening the occasion with spirit and song.</p>

<p>There was another man who belonged to this battery—Lieutenant
James W. Grimshaw—who may properly be
mentioned in this connection. When Fort Sumter fell
there was great excitement in Cleveland, as there was
all over the country. Crowds gathered in the streets and
public places in large numbers. At one of these assemblies
on the Public Square in Cleveland, a man was
imprudent enough to call out “Hurrah for the South!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
Mr. Grimshaw, standing near, immediately shouted, “I
say hurrah for the Union flag!” Soon bitter words
passed between the two men and a rough and tumble
followed in which the rebel sympathizers got much the
worst of the fight. Thus the civil war began in Cleveland!
Lieutenant Grimshaw returned from the war,
was elected to the city council and died some years
since, greatly respected. Another of those who received
a military schooling in the First Regiment, Ohio Volunteer
Light Artillery, under Colonel Barnett, was Corporal
Louis Smithnight. Like Captains Shields and
Wilson, the three months he had been in the war incited
him to further military service. He organized and became
captain of the Twentieth Battery, Ohio Volunteer
Light Artillery, which went into service Oct. 29, 1862,
for a term of three years. The battery was in the siege
at Atlanta, Ga., and in the battles of Dalton and Chickamauga
in that state, and in the battles at Liberty Gap,
Franklin and Nashville, in Tennessee.</p>


<p class="center">BARNETT’S BIG REGIMENT.</p>

<p>Early in the war the governor of Ohio decided to
place in the field a full regiment of artillery. The chief
centers of population in the state readily responded to
the call and twelve companies were soon organized,
numbering in all more than 1,800 men, commanding
seventy-two guns. The command of this large force, a
fair-sized army in itself, was sought by several men of
military distinction. Quartermaster General Wood of
the governor’s staff, who for so many years had been
associated with Colonel Barnett in the old Cleveland
Artillery, strongly recommended the colonel for the position.
Sept. 3, 1861, Governor Dennison gave him his
commission. But not only was Colonel Barnett of
Cleveland’s old gun squad made colonel of this new
regiment, called the First Regiment, Ohio Volunteer
Light Artillery, but three of his associates in this early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
school of artillery training were given commissions of
command next to him.</p>

<p>Captain W. H. Hayward was made lieutenant colonel,
while Walter E. Lawrence and Seymour Race became
majors. To have four of the chief officers of this regiment
all from Cleveland and all of the old Cleveland
artillery, indeed, was high honor. But these men who
had cherished fond hopes of leading their regiments to
the front were destined to be disappointed. An order
came from Washington directing the several batteries
to report, some at one point and some at another, where
their services were deemed most needed. Thus the
companies were separated and the chief field officers were
shorn of active command.</p>

<p>Colonel Barnett, however, was called to a higher position.
He was made chief of artillery on the staff of
General W. S. Rosecrans, one of the best fighting generals
in the Union army; was with him in battle and all
the fortunes of war. Lieutenant Colonel Hayward was
made chief of artillery in the third army corps, third
division of the Army of the Potomac, under General Daniel
Sickles, where he did valiant service until worn out by
hard work, April 1, 1863, under advice of army physicians
he was compelled to resign. Later, however, recovering
something of his health, he was made colonel
of the One Hundred and Fiftieth Regiment, Ohio Volunteer
Infantry. Major Lawrence became a colonel, served
with distinction and died in the service. Major W. F.
Goodspeed, now a resident of Columbus, O., who meets
with the “old artillery association” each year, was one
of the best of the many good fighting men who belonged
to General Barnett’s regiment. He was mustered into
the service as a private, became a lieutenant, then a
captain and came out at the end of the war a major.</p>

<p>Major Seymour Race, heretofore mentioned, served
two years in the war.</p>

<p>Lieutenant John Crable is still another who received
his military training in the old artillery school. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
commissioned second lieutenant in Battery G, Colonel
Barnett’s regiment, and afterwards promoted to first
lieutenant, serving at times as captain. His company
distinguished itself in several important battles and
took part in others of lesser note.</p>


<p class="center">“COMMISSARY” HARRY BINGHAM.</p>

<p>Among the many of the old artillerymen now dead,
few will be better remembered than “Commissary” Harry
Bingham, a man of small stature, full of life and fun.
It may be said that for some years he contributed largely
to the life of his military comrades. At the beginning
of the war he was in Wisconsin, where he soon
joined the military service. He became a lieutenant and
served with credit. Finally, however, the hardships
of war were greater than he could bear. For a time he
lay sick at Nashville, was then brought to Cleveland,
where he died. His disposition to joke did not desert
him even when upon his deathbed. Said he with a
smile, to a lady who called upon him during his last
sickness, “I’m a funeral, sure.” He lies buried in Woodland
cemetery. Who of his old military comrades will
not drop a tear to his memory?</p>

<p>Many others of the old guard, some living and some
dead, deserve well to be mentioned in this connection.</p>

<p>The history of the association itself may be told in
a few lines. At the close of the civil war, when regiments
and various commands in the war were forming
associations and holding reunions, the wife of Captain
Wood, who made all the cartridges used by the old gun
squad, now residing in this city, past eighty-three years
of age, one day suggested to her husband the propriety
of Cleveland’s old artillerymen having a reunion. The
thought was conveyed to General Barnett, Colonel Hayward
and others, who were pleased with the idea and on
the 22d of February, 1871, the members of the old squad
then living and other old Cleveland artillerymen met at
the Kennard House, formed an association of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
General Wood was made president and then and there
had their first banquet. General Wood was continued
president of the association ten years, until his death
May 2, 1881, when General Barnett succeeded him. The
general has been president ever since, some twenty-three
years. At the first meeting of the association held after
General Wood’s death, General Barnett paid a high
tribute to his old comrade. Among other things he said:
“Since our last anniversary David L. Wood, commander
of the old Grey gun squad, captain of the First artillery
company in Cleveland and president of our association
since its first organization, has passed away. It was he
who first introduced into the then West, forty-two years
ago, the artillery branch of our old militia system.
We can say of our old comrade that he was an honest
man. He had a bluff, outspoken way, but a warm, generous
heart. His pride was with his old artillery associates.
His comrades tenderly, with sorrow, laid him
away in the cemetery. We will and do reverence his
memory and our recollections are of a competent soldier,
a patriotic man and good citizen.” General Wood was
born in Barkhamsted, Conn., Aug. 14, 1847, and died
May 2, 1881 in Cleveland at the residence of his brother-in-law,
the Hon. O. J. Hodge.</p>

<p>Thirty-four years have now passed since the first
meeting of the association and each year since it has
had its social gathering, and each Decoration day the
members have strewn with flowers the graves of their
departed comrades. Such meetings, however, cannot be
held many years longer. The whitened locks of these
men point to a day in the near future when the members
of the association will hold their last banquet, when
there will be no member left to decorate the graves of
the departed, but around their memory long will cluster
recollections of patriotic work and good citizenship,
and those now upon life’s stage, and those yet to come,
with pride will study their history and place upon their
graves flowers, emblematic of love and veneration.</p>

<p>The public reception of the First Regiment Ohio Light
Artillery (3 months) at their home as before related
practically closed the military career of that command;
however, a large number of the men enlisted in other
commands, notably into the First Ohio Light Artillery
(3 years) the term being for three years or during the
war. It was soon found that through the emergency
of affairs at the opening of trouble and the improper
muster in and muster out as state troops that the men
had no proper standing on the rolls of the Army of the
United States. This error was called to the attention
of Hon. Amos Townsend, then our member of Congress,
who made many earnest attempts to rectify the mistake
through the Honorable Secretary of War; those efforts
were however unsuccessful, it being decided as the muster
roll showed that they were state troops, so the matter
ran along for years and until Mr. T. E. Burton was
elected to Congress. Upon representation of the case to
Mr. Burton he was at once impressed with the fact that
fairness and justice to the command required action of
Congress, whereupon he introduced a bill substantially
the same as the one finally passed in January 1903, and
given herewith as well as the report of the Military
Committee of which General Dick was chairman.</p>

<p>The command was very fortunate in having in Congress
two such good friends as Mr. Burton and Gen.
Dick, men who have looked so closely and faithfully that
justice might be obtained. The members of the First
Ohio Light Artillery (3 months) owe these two men a
debt of gratitude which they can never pay but which is
not forgotten.</p>

House and ordered to be printed.</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p class="center">Mr. Dick, from the Committee on Military Affairs, submitted
the following</p>


<p class="center">REPORT.</p>

<p class="center">[To accompany H. R. 619.]</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Committee on Military Affairs, to whom was reported
the bill (H. R. 619) providing for the recognition
of the military services of the officers and enlisted men
of the First Regiment Ohio Volunteer Light Artillery,
report the same back to the House with the recommendation
that it do pass with the following amendment:</p>

<p>Add, after the word “organization,” in line 4, page 2,
of the bill, the following: “<em>Provided</em>, That no pay,
bounty, or other emoluments shall become due or payable
by virtue of the passage of this act.”</p>

<p>A bill similar to the one under consideration was reported
favorably by the Committee on Military Affairs
of the Fifty-fourth, Fifty-fifth, and Fifty-sixth Congresses,
which bill, with the accompanying reports, are
hereby adopted and made a part of this report.</p>

<p>It appears that this regiment was the first body of
artillery to engage in the service of the United States
in the late civil war. They were hastened to the front
on the 21st of April, 1861, and rendered valuable service
in the campaign in West Virginia. By an omission,
due to the haste with which they were sent to the front,
they were never formally mustered into the service by
any military officer of the United States. On or about the
30th of May, 1861, while the command was being embarked
at Marietta, Ohio, a United States officer reported to
muster them into the service, but the commanding officer,
General Barnett, stated to him that as his orders
were imperative to move with the least possible delay,
he could not wait the formality of a muster. They served
until the 27th day of July, 1861, and there appears to be
no sufficient reason why their services should not be
recognized and the officers and men considered to have
been in the military service of the United States.</p>
</div>

<p>Reference is made to the affidavit of Gen. James Barnett,
with exhibits, and to the memorandum of Col.
Henry B. Carrington for more complete history of their
service and the reasons why they were not formally
mustered.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">State of Ohio</span>, <em>Cuyahoga County, ss</em>:</p>

<p>James Barnett being duly sworn, deposes and says as
follows: That for some time before the 20th of April,
1861, and at that date I was the commanding officer of
what was known as the First Ohio Light Artillery, organized
under the laws of the State as then existing as
a part of the militia force of the State. On the 20th of
April, 1861, my command was ordered to report for duty,
and immediately thereafter, namely, on the 22d day of
April, 1861, left Cleveland for Marietta, Ohio, where the
command was on duty until May 29 of the same year,
upon which date a portion of the command moved into
Virginia. On the 30th of May, 1861, the remaining portion
of the command went by boat to Benwood and
thence to Grafton, Va., from which time until the date
of their muster out they actively participated in the
campaign in Western Virginia.</p>

<p>On or about the 30th of May, 1861, while the command
was being embarked at Marietta, an officer reported to
muster the command into the service of the United
States. This officer, if I am correct in my recollection,
was Colonel Sill. I am not very positive as to the name
of the officer, but it was either Colonel Sill or Captain
Cram, who said to me that he was sent for the purpose
of mustering my command. We were at the time busily
embarking. A portion of the command had already been
sent down the river to Parkersburg, and I stated to the
officer that it would be impossible to get the men together
for muster, and that our orders were imperative
to move with the least possible delay, so it was concluded
to defer the muster until some proper time after
we had got into Virginia. The command went through
the campaign without muster, and soon after the expiration
of their term of service were ordered back to
Ohio for muster out by orders from the War Department.
Upon arriving at Columbus the command was mustered
in and mustered out upon the same day, dating back
their muster into the date of taking the field. This muster
was made by George S. Mygatt, aid-de-camp to governor
of Ohio, mustering officer. The muster rolls were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
changed from the printed forms, erasing the words
“United States” and inserting “State of Ohio.”</p>

<p>I append hereto as Exhibit A, and make part of this
affidavit, a sketch regarding the movements of the command,
which consisted of about 120 men, and is a correct
statement of its movements. This sketch embraces
pages 711 to 714 of the official register of Ohio troops,
known as the “Ohio Roster,” and published by the
State.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the copy of a letter from the
Adjutant-General, United States Army, to Governor Dennison,
of Ohio, dated July 27, 1861, which appears upon
page 713 of said record, that the command was recognized
by the War Department and under its orders during
its service in Virginia.</p>

<p>The telegraphic orders from General McClellan, commanding
the troops in western Virginia, set forth on
page 712 of said record, and others, were received by me
and executed by me as the commanding officer therein
referred to.</p>

<p>I also append pages 715 to 718 of said record, which
contain the muster roll of the batteries constituting
said command.</p>

<p>Six days after the fall of Fort Sumter the following
telegram was wired to Colonel Barnett:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Columbus, Ohio</span>, <em>April 20, 1861</em>.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Col. James Barnett</span>, <em>Cleveland, Ohio</em>:<br>
</p>

<p>Report your six pieces, caissons and full battery, including
Geneva company, at Columbus forthwith. Monday
if possible. You can hire horses for the guns here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
or at your point of service. Bring harness and everything
else, and twenty men to each gun. You retain
colonel rank.</p>

<p>
By order:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">H. B. Carrington</span>, <em>Adjutant-General</em>.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>The news spread through the city of Cleveland (four
of the batteries were from the city of Cleveland, the
other two being from Brooklyn and Geneva) as though
borne upon the wings Of the wind. Early Sunday morning
Colonel Barnett issued the following order to captains
of the companies:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You will report your command of twenty men, ready
to march to Columbus, tomorrow at 12 o’clock noon at
the public square. You will have your piece, caissons
and harness complete, at the depot between Superior
street and Vineyard lane, with a detail of ten men to
attend to their embarkation, at 9 o’clock a. m., under the
command of a sergeant, and when embarked report to
your superior officers.</p>

<p>By order adjutant-general of Ohio:</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">James Barnett</span>, <em>Colonel 1st Regt. Artillery</em>.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">S. B. Sturges</span>, <em>Lieutenant-Colonel</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>Word having been sent in the meantime to the Brooklyn
and Geneva companies.</p>

<p>Another dispatch was received on Sunday by Colonel
Barnett, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Columbus, Ohio</span>, <em>April 21, 1861</em>.</p>
<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Col. James Barnett</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>Can you bring your command here to-night instead of
waiting till tomorrow? If so, come armed.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">William Dennison</span>, <em>Governor</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>It was found impracticable to assemble the regiment
on Sunday in time to get away on that day. The governor
was informed by telegraph that it would leave early
Monday morning. The two outside companies responded
promptly, and at noon of Monday the regiment left
Cleveland for Columbus, at which place it was ordered
to Marietta via Loveland. Marietta was reached next
morning, when it went into camp on the fair ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
placing the guns in position to guard the city against
any invasion of the enemy.</p>

<p>About the middle of May General McClellan sent Captain
O. M. Poe, of the U. S. A. Engineers, to inspect the
regiment, with a view to its being ready for service at a
moment’s notice. He was greatly pleased with the command
and the drill, discipline and soldierly bearing of its
members. A few days later clothing and camp equipage
were received, all of which were heartily welcomed.
Colonel Barnett also received a telegram from Columbus
to purchase seventy-six horses for his battery upon the
best terms possible; ten thousand dollars having been
placed by the State authorities in a Marietta bank to the
credit of Colonel Barnett, out of which the horses were
to be paid for.</p>

<p>On May 26, 1861, Colonel Barnett received the following
telegram from General McClellan at Cincinnati:
“Expedite the mounting of your batteries and report to
me when ready for service.” Within two days the required
number of horses were purchased and all hands
were busy breaking them into their new sphere of usefulness
and arranging to move on a moment’s notice.
The artillery was re-enforced by the arrival of the 14th
O. V. I. on the 24th day of May and the 18th O. V. I. on
the next day; the 14th being armed and equipped.</p>

<p>On May 27 General McClellan sent the following dispatch
to Colonel Barnett: “Upon the requisition of Colonel
Steadman, you will supply him with a detachment
of two guns, with the proper officers and men.”</p>

<p>On May 29, 1861, Batteries D and F, under command
of Lieut.-Colonel Sturges, left Camp Putnam, Marietta,
by boat, for Parkersburg, W. Va., with orders to report
to Colonel Steadman, 14th O. V. I. They moved rapidly
along the line of the B. &amp; O. Railroad, repairing bridges
destroyed by the enemy, so that on May 31st they had
arrived at Clarksburg, eighty miles east of Parkersburg.
The rebels retreated from Clarksburg to Philippi. From
Clarksburg they moved to Webster, and after a tedious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
night march arrived before Philippi at 4 a. m., making
short work of the rebel force. The roar of the artillery
frightened them so that they fled in dismay, heedless of
their officers, leaving large quantities of supplies and
war materials behind them. (This was the first Light
artillery fired by the national forces in the war of the
rebellion. In this engagement only a few men were
wounded.)</p>

<p>On May 30, 1861, the four companies at Camp Putnam
with Colonel Barnett moved by boat to Benwood, reporting
to General Morris, who ordered Colonel Barnett
to proceed to Grafton, and from there marched to Philippi,
arriving too late to take part in that engagement.
During June the headquarters of the 1st Regiment Light
Artillery was at Philippi. The companies, however,
were scattered; some with their guns did duty as bridge
guards.</p>

<p>July 6th orders were received by General Morris to
advance early the following day, occupy Belington, and
menace the enemy, who were holding a strong position
at Laurel Hill. At daylight the skirmishers struck the
rebel pickets near Belington. The artillery was ordered
to the front and shelled the enemy’s outposts with demoralizing
effect. It was in this skirmish that the artillery
suffered its first casualty—George W. Tillotson, of
Company D, was wounded in the groin by a musket ball,
from the effect of which he died a few years later.</p>

<p>July 12th the rebels retreated from Belington and
Laurel Hill, being pursued by the Union forces to Carrick’s
Ford, where the 1st Artillery opened fire on the
enemy (who were holding a position on a high bank on
the opposite side of the river) with excellent effect. The
enemy fled once more in dismay. The rebel general Robert
S. Garnett was killed in this battle. A fine rifled
piece was captured and presented to the artillery, and
this trophy is now in the public square in the city of
Cleveland.</p>

<p>Its term of service having expired, the regiment moved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
back to Belington, and remained there until ordered to
Columbus to be mustered out. Up to this time, like the
nine regiments of infantry, it was serving as a State
organization, and while all other Ohio three-months
troops were mustered out by United States officers and
recognized as United States troops, this regiment, for
some reason, was mustered out by a member of the governor’s
staff and is recognized by the War Department
as only a <em>State organization</em>. The following letter, however,
will show that it was the intention of the General
Government to place this regiment of artillery on the
same footing as other Ohio organizations that did service
at the same time in West Virginia.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: The nine regiments of Ohio State troops and
Colonel Barnett’s artillery of six guns and one hundred
and twenty men, which have been serving in West Virginia,
will be sent back to Ohio, to be there mustered out
of the service. They, or such of them as may be presented
by you, will there be accepted and mustered into
the United States service for three years as regiments,
companies of cavalry, and batteries of artillery. The
two sections of artillery from Ohio (other than Barnett’s
Battery) and the two companies of cavalry from the
State, all of which have been serving in Virginia, will
also be sent home at the expiration of their three
months’ service, to be there mustered out. They, or
such of them as may be presented by you, will then be
accepted as specified for three years, and will be mustered
into the service of the United States for that period.
The same will be done in regard to the battery of
artillery and the two companies of cavalry at Camp
Chase.</p>

<p>In short, all three-months men are to be sent home to
be mustered out of the service. They, or such of them
as may be presented by you, will there be accepted for
three years and sworn into the service for that period
as regiments, companies of cavalry, and batteries of
artillery.</p>

    <div class="verse indent1">“The muster of the First Ohio Light Artillery.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The peculiar conditions of the Ohio militia organization
at the outbreak of hostilities in 1861 explain the
delay in properly adjusting the record of this pioneer
artillery corps of the United States volunteer service.</p>

<p>Unlike any other State west of Pennsylvania, Ohio had
been for several years engaged in perfecting a militia
system by regiments, brigades, and divisions. State encampments
had been held, and several of its general and
field officers made immediate records after war began.
A single company furnished Major-Generals Walcutt and
Jones to the service.</p>

<p>The artillery was represented by skeleton companies
with one or two guns each. Three companies, each making
technically a “gun section,” were organized at Cleveland,
Brooklyn, and Geneva, with headquarters at
Cleveland. James Barnett, of Cleveland, was commissioned
as colonel, it being the purpose of the adjutant-general
to organize other companies in the State at large.
These three companies or sections, really composing
but one battery proper, was the basis of Colonel Barnett’s
command when ordered to the field April 20, 1861.</p>

<p>This battery had previously been inspected by Gen.
Winfield Scott at Niagara Falls while on an experimental
march, and was well disciplined and equipped. As
early as January, 1861, the previous governor, Salmon
P. Chase, had urged the necessity of having the Ohio
militia ready for sudden summons, and within sixty
hours from receipt of President Lincoln’s first call
twenty disciplined companies (two regiments) were dispatched
to Washington. The incomplete record of the
First Light Artillery grew out of the fact that artillery
had not been called for in the first instance, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
fact that troops were needed upon the State border
before any had been mustered into the United States
service.</p>

<p>By act of Congress, 1789, militia, when called into the
service of the United States, retained their officers. The
governor of Ohio did not deem it wise thus to designate
the general officer to command the troops called for by
the President. A special legislative act promptly provided
that the major-general might be taken from
citizens at large. George B. McClellan was then appointed
and commissioned. The President also appointed
him major-general. But while thousands of the
militia and of volunteers went into camp, none had been
mustered into the United States service when their services
were instantly demanded in West Virginia. A demand
came from Marietta, Ohio, for artillery, as hostile
demonstrations had commenced, tending to the control
of southern Ohio. A telegram received at the Adjutant-General’s
Office on the morning of April 20 to that effect
was followed by an order to Colonel Barnett to report
with his battery forthwith. On the following day, Sunday,
Ambos foundry was fired up and round shot were
cast for use of the battery. A car was sent to Xenia
for powder; flannel was procured, and cartridges were
made for service, as the State had no fixed ammunition
for artillery in its arsenal. On Monday, April 22, Barnett,
having been assured that he would retain his rank
as colonel, reported with his battery in good condition.
The citizens’ committee from Marietta arrived at the
same hour from Loveland, and with the battery at once
returned to Marietta. The only possible “muster” was
to administer the State obligation and make up the roll
as the company was organized. The battery therefore
moved to the border to await orders, but in a position
for defensive duty.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, General Wool, at Watervliet Arsenal, forwarded
arms, so that nine regiments were immediately
organized and armed as State militia, while no volunteers
had as yet been mustered into the United States
service. General Morris, of Indiana (a graduate of
West Point), had been appointed a brigadier-general
from that State, and the regiments of Colonels Dumont
and Milroy had moved to support the regiment of
Colonel Kelley, of the First West Virginia, but they had
no artillery. Governor Dennison, doubtful as to his authority
to push militia across the State boundary, authorized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
the adjutant-general to visit General McClellan
and submit a plan, which General Wool had approved,
and also to act for the State, as the conference might
agree upon a plan. As the result, all of the regiments
in the various camps were put in motion, with no regard
for a United States muster.</p>

<p>Governor Dennison visited Indiana to consult its governor,
and during his absence General McClellan called
for the battery. The following telegram was sent: “Barnett,
borrow money and buy horses instanter.” Also, to
each and all commanders, “Obey promptly all orders of
Major-General McClellan; Governor Dennison puts him
in command of all State troops.”</p>

<p>Neither Colonel Sumner nor Major Cram were then
accessible, and, in fact, no troops were fully ready for
muster; but the battery, supported by the Fourteenth
Ohio, occupied the heights back of Parkersburg, moved
to Grafton, opened the battle of Philippi, and with its
associated Ohio militia regiments and the regiments of
Indiana, saved western Virginia. It rendered United
States service, under United States officers, in brigade
with regularly mustered United States troops. It had
the same claim to full recognition and a muster, nunc
pro tunc, corresponding with the facts.</p>

<p>The Secretary of War, as well as Generals Scott and
Wool, at once recognized the service, and the adjutant-general,
without his solicitation or knowledge in advance,
was appointed colonel of the Eighteenth United
States Infantry, shortly afterwards created by law. The
emergency admitted no delay as to questions of State
boundary, and the battery did as good service as if it had
been that of Captain Bragg, whose precedent it sought
to emulate.</p>

<p>Respectfully submitted.</p>

<p>The movements of this regiment show a service which
was distinctly national in character. On May 29, 1861,
a part of the command moved into Virginia.</p>

<p>On the 30th of May, 1861, the remaining portion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
command went by boat to Benwood and thence to Grafton,
Va., from which time until the date of their muster
out they actively participated in the campaign in western
Virginia.</p>

<p>The command of the troops, after they left Marietta,
Ohio, and embarked for Virginia, passed completely
from the officers of the State of Ohio to the Federal officers.
In May, 1861, General McClellan sent an officer
of the United States Army Engineers to inspect the regiment
“with a view to its being ready for service at a
moment’s notice” for service with the United States. And
the evidence shows that the Federal officer found the
regiment in excellent condition as respects drill, discipline,
and soldierly bearing. Clothing and camp equipage
were also furnished to the regiment by the United
States.</p>

<p>On May 26, 1861, Colonel Barnett, commander of the
regiment, received from General McClellan the following
telegram from Cincinnati: “Expedite the mounting of
your batteries and report to me when ready for service.”
On May 27 General McClellan wired Colonel Barnett:
“Upon requisition of Colonel Steadman you will supply
him with a detachment of two guns, with proper officers
and men.”</p>

<p>On May 29, 1861, Batteries D and F of the regiment
left Marietta, Ohio, for Parkersburg, Va., with orders
to report to Colonel Steadman, Fourteenth Ohio Volunteer
Infantry, which were serving under Federal authority.
They performed important service under such
orders, and were engaged in the battle of Philippi. On
May 30, 1861, four companies of the regiment, with
Colonel Barnett, proceeded by boat to Benwood, and received
orders to proceed to Grafton. They proceeded
thence to Grafton, but too late to take part in the engagement.
July 6, 1861, the regiment was ordered to
Belington, where it was engaged with the enemy. On
July 12 the First Ohio Artillery opened fire upon the
enemy at Carrick’s Ford with excellent effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>The record clearly shows that the Ohio Light Artillery
regiment was taken into Virginia under authority of
and for service with the United States Government.
Such was the understanding of the soldiers and of the
Federal officers under whom they served, and the character
of their service was distinctly national.</p>

<p>The regiment was not called into the service of the
State of Ohio alone, but of other States. Every State
is an integral part of the Union which the Federal Government
is, under the Constitution, bound to protect
against invasion. The evidence shows that the regiment
was employed in general service with and as a
part of the Federal forces, under orders from the Federal
Government, and in the execution of a duty which
was distinctly national in character. The regiment not
only protected Ohio but also Virginia from the attacks
of the enemy, and stayed the advance of the enemy. “It
rendered United States service under United States officers
in brigade with regularly mustered United States
troops.”</p>

<p>And when the term of three months’ enlistment expired,
the regiment, which had been “serving in Virginia,”
was, by order of the War Department dated July
27, 1861, sent back to Ohio, to be there mustered out of
the service of the United States. And the same order
directed that any of such troops or soldiers as should
be tendered should be mustered into the service of the
United States for three years’ service. Owing, no doubt
to an oversight, or to ignorance of the fact that the regiment
had been actually in the service of the United
States, the regiment was mustered out as an organization
of the State of Ohio.</p>

<p>The records of the War Department fail to show facts
upon which justice can be done to this regiment, and
Congress is asked to afford such relief by a special act.
Upon the evidence in the case it is submitted that the
First Regiment Ohio Volunteer Light Artillery is entitled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
to proper recognition as having been in the service
of the United States, and its officers and soldiers
should receive certificates of honorable discharge as
such.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
